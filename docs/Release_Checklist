* Compile the C modules for the major line (1.3) by typing

$ scons

and then run the test suite on all possible architectures to make sure the release is ready.



* Make a copy of the current head to the tags directory using a command such as:

$ svn cp -F svn_msg svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/relax/1.3 svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/relax/tags/1.3.1

In the commit message file 'svn_msg', have a header line which says 'relax version 1.3.1.', followed by a short description of the release.



* Checkout the tagged version with:

$ svn co svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/relax/tags/1.3.1



* Review the SVN logs and add an entry into the CHANGES file (in the 'docs/' directory) for the current release.  Create three sections titled 'Features', 'Changes', and 'Bugfixes'.  Commit the changes and then port the revision back into the main line.



* Change the version number in file 'version.py' and commit the change.



* Build the PDF version of the relax user manual by typing:

$ scons user_manual_pdf

then add the manual to the repository:

$ svn add docs/relax.pdf

and commit all the changes.  Clean up the temporary files with:

$ scons clean



* Bundle minfx and bmrblib by checking out the current trunk:

$ svn co svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/minfx/trunk/minfx
$ svn co svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/bmrblib/trunk/bmrblib



* Generate the source distribution files (and their GPG signatures) by typing:

$ scons source_dist key=xxxxx

where xxxxx is the name of your GPG key.



* Generate the binary distribution files for each platform (and their GPG signatures) by typing:

$ scons binary_dist key=xxxxx

If the key is not supplied, or incorrectly supplied, the distribution file will be created but not signed.  To sign the file later, type:

$ gpg --detach-sign --default-key xxxxx relax-1.3.1.GNU-Linux.x86_64.tar.bz2



* Build other distribution packages by checking out the tag and bundling minfx and bmrblib.:

$ svn co svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/relax/tags/1.3.1
$ cd 1.3.1
$ svn co svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/minfx/trunk/minfx
$ svn co svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/bmrblib/trunk/bmrblib
$ scons binary_dist key=xxxxx

Or:

$ svn co http://svn.gna.org/svn/relax/tags/1.3.1
$ cd 1.3.1
$ svn co http://svn.gna.org/svn/minfx/trunk/minfx
$ svn co http://svn.gna.org/svn/bmrblib/trunk/bmrblib
$ scons binary_dist



* Move the distribution files and their signatures, as well as the PDF manual, to the mirror directory for the relax download site.  This directory should contain all the files and directories accessible from 'http://download.gna.org/relax/'.  First make sure the mirror directory contains all of the files so that the next command does not accidentally delete files:

$ rsync -av --progress --no-perms --rsh="ssh" bugman@download.gna.org:/upload/relax/ .

Then rsync the entire directory contents to download.gna.org/upload/relax/ using the command:

$ rsync --delete -av --progress --no-perms --rsh="ssh" . bugman@download.gna.org:/upload/relax/



* Modify the http://www.nmr-relax.com/download.html webpage to point to the newest version of relax.  Update the MD5 checksums and file sizes on the download page.  Commit the updates.



* Create the HTML version of the manual with the command:

$ scons user_manual_html

Replace the old manual with the new in the http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual SVN repository (http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/relax/website) and commit the new manual.



* Create the API documentation for the current version with the command:

$ scons api_manual_html

Replace the old API documentation in the http://www.nmr-relax.com/api SVN repository (http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/relax/website) and commit the new files.



* Add the version number to the bug tracker field 'Release' at https://gna.org/bugs/admin/field_values.php?group=relax.



* Post the release message to the relax-announce mailing list, as a news item on the relax Gna! website, and on the freshmeat website.

On the relax-announce mailing list, write a detailed and full description of the release.  Also add a paragraph with links for downloading the release.  At the end, add a section titled 'The full list of changes is:' and cut and paste the part of the CHANGES file for this release.  Include links to the trackers in the full list of changes.

For the news item, firstly cut and paste the mailing list message.  Item references such as bug #7641, task #3122, etc. are automatically converted into links.  Create three sections using the Savane markup (recipe #236).  Call these = Description =, = Download =, and = Full list of changes =.  For the last section, use the subtitles == Features == ,  == Changes == , and  == Bugfixes ==.  The items in this section start with '* ' to create an unnumbered list.  Strip all leading whitespace from the full list of changes and remove all the links to the trackers (as these will be automatically created).

For Freecode (http://freecode.com, formally Freshmeat), go to the nmr-relax project page at http://freecode.com/projects/nmr-relax.  Click on 'All releases' in the 'Recent releases' section, then on 'Submit new release'.  If this is the first release of a new minor number 'x.x.0', a branch will need to be created first by clicking on 'add branch'.  Add the version number, a brief and concise summary of the release, select the release focus category, and update the Tar/BZ2 and Zip URLs.
