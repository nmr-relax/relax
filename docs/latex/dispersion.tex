\section{Introduction to relaxation dispersion}

Relaxation dispersion is the experimental modulation of chemical exchange relaxation.  For the $\Ronerho$-type experiment in which the nucleus of interest is spin-locked, either the spin-lock field strength or the offset between the spin-lock pulse and the chemical shift of the spins is used to modulate the exchange.  For the CPMG-type experiment, varying the time between the pulses modules the exchange.  Both experiment types are handled by relax.

\subsection{The modelling of dispersion data}

For a system under the influence of chemical exchange, the evolution of the transverse magnetisation is given by the \citet{Bloch46} equations as modified by \citet{McConnell58} for chemical exchange -- the Bloch-McConnell equations.
For a two state exchange jumping between states A and B, the equation is:

\begin{equation} \label{eq: Bloch-McConnell}
    \frac{d}{dt} \left[ 
        \begin{array}{c}
            M_A^+(t) \\
            M_B^+(t)
        \end{array}
    \right] = \left[
        \begin{array}{cc}
            -i\Omega_A-\RtwozeroA-\pB\kex & \pA\kex \\
            \pB\kex & -i\Omega_B-\RtwozeroB-\pA\kex \\
        \end{array}
    \right] \left[
        \begin{array}{c}
            M_A^+(t) \\
            M_B^+(t)
        \end{array}
    \right] .
\end{equation}

The solution to this equation then Fourier transformed to produce the NMR spectrum.  However the analytic or closed-form frequency-domain solution remains intractable.

Solutions can nevertheless be found by either making assumptions or restrictions about the exchange process and then analytically solving~\ref{eq: Bloch-McConnell} or by finding numeric solutions.
The modelling of relaxation dispersion data can hence be catergorised into these two distinct methodologies:

\begin{description}
\item[Analytical models:]\index{relaxation dispersion!Analytical model}  Optimisation of models based on analytical, closed-form expressions derived from the Bloch-McConnell equations subject to certain conditions (see Section~\ref{sect: dispersion: analytic CPMG models} on page~\pageref{sect: dispersion: analytic CPMG models} and Section~\ref{sect: dispersion: analytic R1rho models} on page~\pageref{sect: dispersion: analytic R1rho models}).
\item[Numerical models:]\index{relaxation dispersion!Numerical model}  Optimisation of models based on numerically solving the Bloch-McConnell equations (see Section~\ref{sect: dispersion: numeric CPMG models} on page~\pageref{sect: dispersion: numeric CPMG models} and Section~\ref{sect: dispersion: numeric R1rho models} on page~\pageref{sect: dispersion: numeric R1rho models}).

\subsection{Dispersion model summary}

Except for `R2eff' and `No Rex', all models can be fit to clusterings of spins, or spin blocks.
The models are described in more detail below and summarised in Table~\ref{table: dispersion models}.
The parameters of the models and of relaxation dispersion in general are given in Table~\ref{table: dispersion parameters}.

\section{The base dispersion models}
\label{sect: dispersion: base models}

% R2eff model.
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\subsection{The R2eff model}
\label{sect: dispersion: R2eff model}
\index{relaxation dispersion!R2eff model|textbf}

This is the simplest of all models in that the dispersion component of the base data -- the peak intensity values -- is not modelled.  It is used to determine either the $\Rtwoeff$ or $\Ronerho$ values and errors as required for the base data for all other models.  It can be selected by setting the model to `R2eff'.  Depending on the experiment type, this model will be handled differently.  The $\Rtwoeff$/$\Ronerho$ values determined can be later copied to the data pipes of the other dispersion models using the appropriate user functions.


% Fixed relaxation period experiments.
\subsubsection{Fixed relaxation period experiments}

For the fixed relaxation time period CPMG-type experiments, the $\Rtwoeff$/$\Ronerho$ values are determined by direct calculation using the formula
\begin{equation}
    \Rtwoeff(\nucpmg) = - \frac{1}{T_\textrm{relax}} \cdot \ln \left( \frac{I_1(\nucpmg)}{I_0} \right) .
\end{equation}

The values and errors are determined with a single call of the \uf{calc} user function.  The $\Ronerho$ version of the equation is essentially the same:
\begin{equation}
    \Ronerho(\omega_1) = - \frac{1}{T_\textrm{relax}} \cdot \ln \left( \frac{I_1(\omega_1)}{I_0} \right) .
\end{equation}

Errors are calculated using the formula
\begin{equation} \label{eq: dispersion error}
    \sigma_{\Rtwo} = \frac{1}{T_\textrm{relax}} \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\sigma_{I_1}}{I_1(\omega_1)} \right)^2  +  \left( \frac{\sigma_{I_0}}{I_0} \right)^2 } .
\end{equation}

In a number of publications, the error formula from \citet{IshimaTorchia05} has been used.  This is the collapse of Equation~\ref{eq: dispersion error} by setting $\sigma_{I_0}$ to zero:
\begin{equation} \label{eq: IT05 dispersion error}
    \sigma_{\Rtwo} = \frac{\sigma_{I_1}}{T_\textrm{relax} I_1(\omega_1)} .
\end{equation}

This is not implemented in relax as it can be shown by simple simulation that the formula is incorrect (see Figure~\ref{fig: dispersion error comparison}).  This formula significantly underestimates the real errors.  The use of the same $I_0$ value for all dispersion points does not cause a decrease in the $\Rtwoeff$ error but rather a correlation in the errors.

This plot was generated using the script \file{test\_suite/shared\_data/dispersion/error\_testing/simulation.py}.  The bootstrapping simulation involves randomising noise-free $I_0$ and $I_1$ values for each dispersion data point assuming Gaussian errors.  The full error formula is from Equation~\ref{eq: dispersion error}, the reduced error formula is from Equation~\ref{eq: IT05 dispersion error}, the bootstrapping using individual dispersion points estimates the errors assuming different $I_0$ randomisations for each dispersion point and each simulation, and the bootstrapping group graph uses the same randomised $I_0$ value for all dispersion points for each simulation.}
\end{figure*}


% Variable relaxation period experiments.
\subsubsection{Variable relaxation period experiments}

For the variable relaxation time period type experiments, the $\Rtwoeff$/$\Ronerho$ values are determined by fitting to the simple two parameter exponential as in a $\Rone$ or $\Rtwo$ analysis.  Both $\Rtwoeff$/$\Ronerho$ and the initial peak intensity $I_0$ are optimised using the minimise user function for each exponential curve separately.  Monte Carlo simulations are used to obtain the parameter errors.



% No Rex model.

\subsection{The model for no chemical exchange relaxation}
\label{sect: dispersion: No Rex model}
\index{relaxation dispersion!No Rex model|textbf}

This model is provided for model selection purposes.  In combination with frequentist methods, such as AIC\index{model selection!AIC}, or Bayesian methods\index{model selection!Bayesian} it can show if the presence of chemical exchange is statistically significant.  Optimisation is still required as one $\Rtwozero$ value per magnetic field strength will be fit to the measured data for each spin system.  It is selected by setting the model to `No Rex'.

% LM63 model.
%~~~~~~~~~~~~

\subsection{The LM63 2-site fast exchange CPMG model}
\label{sect: dispersion: LM63 model}
\index{relaxation dispersion!LM63 model|textbf}

This is the original model for 2-site fast exchange for CPMG-type experiments.
It is selected by setting the model to `LM63', here named after \citet{LuzMeiboom63}.
The original $n$-site Equation~(7) from their paper can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    \Rex = \left[ 1 - 2\tex\taucpmg \cdot \tanh \left( 2\tex\taucpmg \right)^{-1} \right] \cdot \tex \cdot \sum_{i=2}^n p_\textrm{i}\dw_{i} ,
\end{equation}

or rearranged as:
\begin{equation} \label{eq: Luz-Meiboom}
    \Rex = \sum_{i=2}^n \frac{\Phiexi}{\textrm{k}_\textrm{i}} \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{4\nucpmg}{\textrm{k}_\textrm{i}} \cdot \tanh \left( \frac{\textrm{k}_\textrm{i}}{4\nucpmg} \right) \right) ,
\end{equation}


The equation for the 2-site exchange process can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
    \Rtwoeff = \Rtwozero + \frac{\Phiex}{\kex} \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{4\nucpmg}{\kex} \cdot \tanh \left( \frac{\kex}{4\nucpmg} \right) \right) .
\end{equation}

% LM63 3-site model.
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\subsection{The LM63 3-site fast exchange CPMG model}
\label{sect: dispersion: LM63 3-site model}
\index{relaxation dispersion!LM63 3-site model|textbf}

This is the original \citet{LuzMeiboom63} model for 3-site fast exchange for CPMG-type experiments.
It is selected by setting the model to `LM63 3-site'.
Taking the original Equation~\ref{eq: Luz-Meiboom}, the equation for 3-site exchange is simply:
\begin{equation}
    \Rex = \sum_{i=2}^3 \frac{\Phiexi}{\textrm{k}_\textrm{i}} \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{4\nucpmg}{\textrm{k}_\textrm{i}} \cdot \tanh \left( \frac{\textrm{k}_\textrm{i}}{4\nucpmg} \right) \right) ,
\end{equation}

The reference for this equation is:
\begin{itemize}
\item \bibentry{LuzMeiboom63}
\end{itemize}

This model is only provided as a demonstration and should not be used for a normal analysis.
Without data at multiple temperatures, a feature not currently supported within relax, that there are infinite lines of solutions and that the $\PhiexB$, $\PhiexC$, $\kB$ and $\kC$ parameters are all convoluted together.

This equation was made more practically relevant in the paper of \citet{OConnell09}.
This relies on the assumption that site~1 (or~A) has a much larger equilibrium population than the other sites ($\pA \gg \pB$ and $\pA \gg \pC$).
As stated, ``if the different values of ji are well-separated (by a factor of 3-10), then Eq.~3 reduces approximately to the sum of n~-~1 independent two-state processes for exchange between site~1 and the n~-~1 other sites''.
In this situation, the following relationships hold
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    &\kB \approx \kexB = \kAB + \kBA , \\
    &\kC \approx \kexC = \kAC + \kCA ,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

and
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    &\PhiexB = \overline{\Phiex} \frac{\kexB^2 \left( \overline{\kex} - \kexC \right)}{\kex^2 \left( \kex - \kexC \right)} , \label{eq: disp phiexB} \\
    &\PhiexC = \overline{\Phiex} \frac{\kexC^2 \left( \overline{\kex} - \kexB \right)}{\kex^2 \left( \kexC - \kexB \right)} , \label{eq: disp phiexC}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

with
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    &\overline{\PhiexB} \approx (\pA + \pC) \pB \dwAB^2 , \\
    &\overline{\PhiexC} \approx (\pA + \pB) \pC \dwAC^2 .
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

The parameter deconvolutions for this model can be performed after a relax analysis, if desired.



% Full CR72 model.

\subsection{The full CR72 2-site CPMG model}
\label{sect: dispersion: CR72 full model}
\index{relaxation dispersion!CR72 full model|textbf}

This is the model for 2-site exchange on all times scales (with the constraint that $\pA > \pB$), named after \citet{CarverRichards72}.
It is selected by setting the model to `CR72 full'.
The equation is
\begin{equation}
    \Rtwoeff = \frac{1}{2} \Big( \RtwozeroA + \RtwozeroB + \kex - 2\nucpmg\cosh^{-1} \big( D_+\cosh(\eta_+) - D_-\cos(\eta_-) \big) \Big) ,
\end{equation}

where
\begin{align}
    D_\pm    &= \frac{1}{2} \left( \pm1 + \frac{\Psi + 2\dw^2}{\sqrt{\Psi^2 + \zeta^2}} \right) , \\
    \eta_\pm &= 2^{\frac{2}{3}}\frac{1}{\nucpmg} \left( \pm\Psi + \sqrt{\Psi^2 + \zeta^2} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} , \\
    \Psi     &= \left( \RtwozeroA - \RtwozeroB - \pA\kex + \pB\kex \right)^2 - \dw^2 + 4\pA\pB\kex^2 , \\
    \zeta    &= 2\dw \left( \RtwozeroA - \RtwozeroB - \pA\kex + \pB\kex \right).

\subsection{The reduced CR72 2-site CPMG model}

This is the model for 2-site exchange on all times scales (with the constraint that $\pA > \pB$), named after \citet{CarverRichards72}.
It is selected by setting the model to `CR72'.
It is the same as the full CR72 model described above, but with the simplification that $\RtwozeroA = \RtwozeroB$.
This simplifies the equations to
\begin{equation}
    \Rtwoeff = \Rtwozero + \frac{\kex}{2} - \nucpmg\cosh^{-1} \big( D_+\cosh(\eta_+) - D_-\cos(\eta_-) \big) ,
\end{equation}

where $D_\pm$ and $\eta_\pm$ are unchanged and
\begin{align}
    \Psi  &= \kex^2 - \dw^2 , \\
    \zeta &= -2\dw (\pA\kex - \pB\kex) .
\end{align}



% IT99 model.

\subsection{The IT99 2-site CPMG model}
\label{sect: dispersion: IT99 model}
\index{relaxation dispersion!IT99 model|textbf}

This is the model for 2-site exchange on all times scales (with the constraint that $\pA \gg \pB$), named after \citet{IshimaTorchia99}.  It is selected by setting the model to `IT99'.  The equation is:
\begin{align}
    \Rex       &\simeq \frac{\Phiex\tex}{1 + \omega_a^2\tex^2} , \\
    \omega_a^2 &= \sqrt{\omega_\textrm{1eff}^4 + \pA^2\dw^4} , \\
    \Rtwoeff   &= \Rtwozero + \Rex .
\end{align}

The effective rotating frame field for a CPMG-type experiment is given by
\begin{equation}
    \omega_\textrm{1eff} = 2\sqrt{3}\nucpmg ,
\end{equation}

and hence
\begin{equation}
    \omega_\textrm{1eff}^4 = 144\nucpmg^4 .

% TSMFK01 model.

\subsection{The TSMFK01 2-site CPMG model}

\index{relaxation dispersion!TSMFK01 model|textbf}



This is the model for 2-site very-slow exchange model for time scales within range of microsecond to second time scale, where $\pA \gg \pB$, and named after \citet{Tollinger01}.  It is selected by setting the model to `TSMFK01'.  A particularly interesting feature of the dispersion curves is the damped oscillations, which occur at low CPMG field strengths, and is solely a function of the chemical shift difference between the two sites (i.e., independent of the rate of exchange).  

The equation is:
\begin{align}
    \Rtwoeff = \RtwozeroA + \kAB - \kAB \frac{\sin{(\dw \cdot \taucpmg )}}{\dw \cdot \taucpmg}
\end{align}

\subsection{The NS 2-site expanded CPMG model}
\label{sect: dispersion: NS CPMG 2-site expanded model}
\index{relaxation dispersion!NS CPMG 2-site expanded model|textbf}

This is the numerical model for 2-site exchange expanded using Maple by Nikolai Skrynnikov.
It is selected by setting the model to `NS CPMG 2-site expanded'.
The simple constraint $\pA > \pB$ is used to halve the optimisation space, as both sides of the limit are mirror image spaces.

This model will give the same results as the other numerical solutions whereby $\RtwozeroA = \RtwozeroB$.  The following is the set of equations of the expansion used in relax.  It has been modified from the original for speed.  See the \module{lib.dispersion.ns\_cpmg\_2site\_expanded} module for more details including the original code.  Further simplifications can be found in the code.

The relative peak intensities, magnitisation, and effective $\Rtwo$ relaxation rate are calculated as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    I_0 &= \pA, \\
    I_1 &= \Re(t_{139}) \exp(-T_\textrm{relax} \Rtwozero), \\
    M_x &= I_1 / I_0, \\
    \Rtwoeff &= -\frac{1}{T_\textrm{relax}} \cdot \ln \left( M_x \right). \label{eq: R2eff NS CPMG 2-site expanded}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

In these equations $\taucpmg$ and $n_\textrm{CPMG}$ are numpy arrays and hence $t_{139}$ is also a numpy array.  This avoids a Python loop over the dispersion points until the very end of the calculation, required to populate the $\Rtwoeff$ data structure, resulting in very fast calculations.

\subsection{Dispersion script mode -- the sample script}

The following is a verbatim copy of the contents of the \file{sample\_scripts/relax\_disp/\linebreak[0]{}cpmg\_analysis.py} file.
You will need to first copy this script to a dedicated analysis directory containing peak lists, a sequence or PDB file and a file listing unresolved spin systems, and then modify its contents to suit your specific analysis.
The script contents are:

% The imports.
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\subsection{Dispersion script mode -- imports} \label{sect: dispersion script imports}

At the very start of the script are two import statements.  This is simply the standard Python import system for modules.  The first will import the \pycode{sep} variable which is the operating system independent directory separator:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=4]
# Python module imports.
from os import sep
\end{lstlisting}

This \pycode{sep} variable will be used later on in the script.  The second import is that of the automated relaxation dispersion class \pycode{Relax\_disp} which will be used at the very end of the script to perform the full analysis:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=7]
# relax module imports.
from auto_analyses.relax_disp import Relax_disp
\end{lstlisting}


% The analysis variables.
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\subsection{Dispersion script mode -- analysis variables} \label{sect: dispersion script variables}

The next part of the script is the definition of a number of analysis variables.  As the example in this section is for CPMG-type experiments, the relaxation dispersion models which will be used in the auto-analysis are:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=14]
# The dispersion models.
MODELS = ['R2eff', 'No Rex', 'LM63', 'CR72', 'IT99', 'TSMFK01', 'NS CPMG 2-site expanded']
\end{lstlisting}

If you have $\Ronerho$-type data, the models could be changed to:

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
# The dispersion models.
MODELS = ['R2eff', 'No Rex', 'M61', 'DPL72', 'TP02']
\end{lstlisting}

The next variable affects the optimisation precision:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=17]
# The grid search size (the number of increments per dimension).
GRID_INC = 21
\end{lstlisting}

The number of grid search increments may be decreased, but only after careful checking with a higher number of increments.  Setting this value too low may place the initial optimisation too far away from the minimum.  Although as-of-yet undetected and unpublished, if multiple local minima do exist then optimisation may not reach the global minimum.  Too little grid search increments can also cause the total optimisation time to increase as the Nelder-Mead simplex\index{optimisation!simplex algorithm}\index{optimisation!Nelder-Mead algorithm} optimisation together with the Logarithmic-barrier penalty function\index{optimisation!logarithmic-barrier penalty function} as used in the auto-analysis may require more time to reach the minimum.

The Monte Carlo simulation\index{Monte Carlo simulation} number \pycode{MC\_NUM} variable affects the error estimate precision:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=20]
# The number of Monte Carlo simulations to be used for error analysis at the end of the analysis.
MC_NUM = 500
\end{lstlisting}

For accurate parameter errors this number should not be decreased.  Ideally it should be increased however this will significantly increase the total analysis time.

The last variable defines how the best dispersion model for the measured data is chosen:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=23]
# The model selection technique to use.
MODSEL = 'AIC'
\end{lstlisting}

For the automated analysis, currently only AIC\index{model selection!AIC}, AICc\index{model selection!AICc}, and BIC\index{model selection!BIC} are supported.  For details about these frequentist\index{model selection!frequentist} model selection techniques and their application to NMR data, see \citet{dAuvergneGooley03}.  Post-analysis comparisons can also be preformed if desired.


% Initialisation of the data pipe.
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\subsection{Dispersion script mode -- initialisation of the data pipe} \label{sect: dispersion initialisation}

The data pipe is created using the lines:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=30]
# Create the data pipe.
pipe_name = 'base pipe'
pipe_bundle = 'relax_disp'
pipe.create(pipe_name=pipe_name, bundle=pipe_bundle, pipe_type='relax_disp')
\end{lstlisting}

The first two lines define variables for the data pipe name and the pipe bundle name.  The pipe bundle is used to group together all of the data pipes created by the automated protocol.  See section~\ref{sect: data pipe bundles} on page~\pageref{sect: data pipe bundles} for more details.

The \uf{pipe.create} user function will then create a relaxation dispersion specific data pipe labelled with the pipe and bundle names.  The third argument sets the pipe type to that of relaxation dispersion.  The rest of the script is used to fill this base data pipe with all of the data required for a dispersion analysis.  The auto-analysis will then copy the data from this pipe as it sees fit.


% Spin systems.
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\subsection{Dispersion script mode -- setting up the spin systems}

The first thing which needs to be completed prior to any spin specific command is to generate the molecule, residue and spin data structures for storing the spin specific data.  In the sample script above, this is generated from a plain text file with the sequence information, however a PDB file can be used instead (see the \uf{structure.read\_pdb} user function on page~\pageref{uf: structure.read_pdb} for more details).  In the case of the sample script, the command:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=35]
# Load the sequence.
sequence.read('fake_sequence.in', res_num_col=1, res_name_col=2)
\end{lstlisting}

will load residue names and numbers from the \file{fake\_sequence.in} file into relax, creating one spin per residue.  Then:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=38]
# Name the spins so they can be matched to the assignments, and the isotope for field strength scaling.
spin.name(name='N')
spin.isotope(isotope='15N')
\end{lstlisting}

will set up the spin information required for loading the peak intensity data from Sparky peak lists and for the analysis of the dispersion data.


% Loading the data.
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\subsection{Dispersion script mode -- loading the data}

To load the peak intensities\index{peak!intensity} into relax, a large data structure is first defined:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=42]

]
\end{lstlisting}

In Python terminology, this is a list of lists data structure.  It is essentially a matrix of information which is used in the subsequent \pycode{for} loop.  The comment explains what each element is.  For $\Ronerho$-type experiments, the CPMG frequency column can be replaced with the spin-lock field strength.  This data structure will need to be tailored to your data.  It can be seen that the \pycode{sep} variable is now being used to specify that the Sparky files are either located in the \directory{500\_MHz} or \directory{800\_MHz} directories.  It is used here to make this script independent of the operating system.

The Python \pycode{for} loop starts with the lines:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=84]
# Loop over the spectra.
for id, file, cpmg_frq, H_frq in data:
\end{lstlisting}

and includes all subsequently indented lines.  This line of code takes the elements of the \pycode{data} data structure and splits it into 4 variables.  Therefore for the first line, \pycode{id} will be set to \pycode{`500\_reference.in'}, \pycode{file} will be set to \pycode{`500\_MHz/reference.in\_sparky'} on a Linux machine, \pycode{cpmg\_frq} will be \pycode{None}, and \pycode{H\_frq} will be 500~MHz.  For $\Ronerho$-type data, you could change the \pycode{cpmg\_frq} variable to \pycode{field} for example.

The first user function in the block loads the peak intensity data from the peak lists:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=86]
    # Load the peak intensities.
    spectrum.read_intensities(file=file, spectrum_id=id, int_method='height')
\end{lstlisting}

This assumes that peak heights were measured.  All data will be tagged with the given ID string.  For examples of peak list formats supported by relax, see Section~\ref{sect: Rx data loading} on page~\pageref{sect: Rx data loading}.
The next step is to specify the dispersion experiment type for each spectrum:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=89]
    # Set the relaxation dispersion experiment type.
    relax_disp.exp_type(spectrum_id=id, exp_type='CPMG')
\end{lstlisting}

This can either be \pycode{`CPMG'} or \pycode{`R1rho'}.
The next user function sets the CPMG frequencies for each spectrum:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=92]
    # Set the relaxation dispersion CPMG frequencies.
    relax_disp.cpmg_frq(spectrum_id=id, cpmg_frq=cpmg_frq)
\end{lstlisting}

For an $\Ronerho$-type experiment, these lines could be changed to:

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
    # Set the relaxation dispersion R1rho spin lock field strength.
    relax_disp.spin_lock_field(spectrum_id=id, field=field)
\end{lstlisting}

Then the NMR spectrometer field strength is set:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=95]
    # Set the NMR field strength of the spectrum.
    spectrometer.frequency(id=id, frq=H_frq)
\end{lstlisting}

And finally the relaxation time period is set with:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=98]
    # Relaxation dispersion CPMG constant time delay T (in s).
    relax_disp.relax_time(spectrum_id=id, time=0.030)
\end{lstlisting}

If exponential data has been collected rather than fixed time period data, then the \pycode{data} data structure can have an additional column added for the relaxation times, and then this same user function can be used.  The \pycode{for} loop will need one extra variable for the times, and this should be passed into this \uf{relax\_disp.relax\_time} user function for the time argument.

Finally, once the \pycode{for} loop has completed, replicated spectra are defined with the commands:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=101]
# Specify the duplicated spectra.
spectrum.replicated(spectrum_ids=['500_133.33.in', '500_133.33.in.bis'])
spectrum.replicated(spectrum_ids=['500_533.33.in', '500_533.33.in.bis'])
spectrum.replicated(spectrum_ids=['500_933.33.in', '500_933.33.in.bis'])
spectrum.replicated(spectrum_ids=['800_133.33.in', '800_133.33.in.bis'])
spectrum.replicated(spectrum_ids=['800_533.33.in', '800_533.33.in.bis'])
spectrum.replicated(spectrum_ids=['800_933.33.in', '800_933.33.in.bis'])
\end{lstlisting}


% The rest of the setup.

\subsection{Dispersion script mode -- the rest of the setup} \label{sect: dispersion setup fin}

Once all the peak intensity data has been loaded a few calculations are required prior to optimisation.  Firstly the peak intensities for individual spins needs to be averaged across replicated spectra.  The peak intensity errors also have to be calculated using the standard deviation formula.  These two operations are executed by the user functions:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=109]
# Peak intensity error analysis.
spectrum.error_analysis(subset=['500_reference.in', '500_66.667.in', '500_133.33.in', '500_133.33.in.bis', '500_200.in', '500_266.67.in', '500_333.33.in', '500_400.in', '500_466.67.in', '500_533.33.in', '500_533.33.in.bis', '500_600.in', '500_666.67.in', '500_733.33.in', '500_800.in', '500_866.67.in', '500_933.33.in', '500_933.33.in.bis', '500_1000.in'])
spectrum.error_analysis(subset=['800_reference.in', '800_66.667.in', '800_133.33.in', '800_133.33.in.bis', '800_200.in', '800_266.67.in', '800_333.33.in', '800_400.in', '800_466.67.in', '800_533.33.in', '800_533.33.in.bis', '800_600.in', '800_666.67.in', '800_733.33.in', '800_800.in', '800_866.67.in', '800_933.33.in', '800_933.33.in.bis', '800_1000.in'])
\end{lstlisting}

Here the 500~MHz and 800~MHz peak intensity errors have been calculated separately as they should not be the same.

Any spins which cannot be resolved due to peak overlap were included in a file called \file{unresolved}.  This file can consist of optional columns of the molecule name, the residue name and number, and the spin name and number.  The matching spins are excluded from the analysis by the user functions:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=113]
# Deselect unresolved spins.
deselect.read(file='unresolved', dir='500_MHz', res_num_col=1)
deselect.read(file='unresolved', dir='800_MHz', res_num_col=1)
\end{lstlisting}


% Execution.
%~~~~~~~~~~~
\subsection{Dispersion script mode -- execution}

Once the data has set up and you have modified your script to match your analysis needs, then the data pipe, pipe bundle and analysis variables are passed into the \module{Relax\linebreak[0]{}\_disp} class.  This is the final lines of the script:

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=119]
# Auto-analysis execution.
##########################

# Do not change!
Relax_disp(pipe_name=pipe_name, pipe_bundle=pipe_bundle, models=MODELS, grid_inc=GRID_INC, mc_sim_num=MC_NUM, modsel=MODSEL)
\end{lstlisting}

This will start the auto-analysis.

\section{To do -- dispersion features yet to be implemented}
\label{sect: dispersion: TODO}

The capabilities of the relaxation dispersion analysis in relax is expansive but it cannot be called complete.
There are a number of features and models yet to be implemented.
Missing features include:
\begin{itemize}
\item The handling of off-resonance effects in the models of the numeric solution for CPMG-type data.
This is specifically the `NS CPMG 2-site 3D' and `NS CPMG 2-site star' models and their `* full' equivalents.
The necessary infrastructure is in place, but not activated yet (mainly due to a lack of synthetic data to test against).
\item Multi-state data -- the handling of data from two sets of peaks from the same spin system is not properly supported.
It is currently handled by assuming each state is a separate spin system but this means that $\dw$, $\dwH$ and related parameters are not shared as they should be.
\item The van't Hoff analysis of multi-temperature dispersion data (see \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van\_\%27t\_Hoff\_equation}).
\item HD exchange.
\end{itemize}

If you would like one of these features, please contact the ``relax-devel at gna.org''\index{mailing list!relax-devel} mailing list.
The most useful would be if you have synthetic data whereby you know what the true solution should be.
This can then be incorporated into a relax system test and the feature implemented to allow the test to pass.
Note that such data should never be emailed to a public mailing list!
Synthetic data, or experimental data, can be obtained from the literature.

Some of the missing models include:
\begin{description}
\item[`NS CPMG 3-site':]\index{relaxation dispersion!NS CPMG 3-site model}  The model of the numeric solution for 3-site exchange for CPMG-type data.
\item[`NS $\Ronerho$ 3-site':]\index{relaxation dispersion!NS R1rho 3-site model}  The model of the numeric solution for 3-site exchange for $\Ronerho$-type data.
\item[`MQ NS $\Ronerho$ 2-site':]\index{relaxation dispersion!MQ NS R1rho 2-site model}  The model of the numeric solution for 2-site exchange for multiple quantum $\Ronerho$-type data.
\item[`MQ NS CPMG 3-site':]\index{relaxation dispersion!MQ NS CPMG 3-site model}  The model of the numeric solution for 3-site exchange for multiple quantum CPMG-type data.
\item[`MQ NS $\Ronerho$ 3-site':]\index{relaxation dispersion!MQ NS R1rho 3-site model}  The model of the numeric solution for 3-site exchange for multiple quantum $\Ronerho$-type data.
\end{description}

Information for how these can be added is given in the next section.

\section{Tutorial for adding relaxation dispersion models}
\label{sect: dispersion: model tutorial}

As the field of NMR relaxation dispersion has a very long history, it is not possible to include all analytic and numeric relaxation dispersion models for both CPMG-type\index{relaxation dispersion!CPMG-type experiment} or $\Ronerho$-type\index{relaxation dispersion!$\Ronerho$-type experiment} experiments in relax.  However it is not too difficult to add new models for your own needs if you have some Python, Matlab, Mathematica, or similar scripting skills.  The steps required are detailed on the \href{http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/}{relax wiki} page \url{http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/Tutorial\_for\_adding\_relaxation\_dispersion\_models\_to\_relax}.
