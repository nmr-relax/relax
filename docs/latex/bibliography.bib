  abstract       = {It has recently become more widely appreciated that
                   the presence of rotational diffusional anisotropy in
                   proteins and other macromolecules can have a
                   significant affect on the interpretation of NMR
                   relaxation data in terms of molecular motion. In this
                   paper, we show how commonly used NMR relaxation data
                   (R(1), R(2), and NOE) obtained at two spectrometer
                   frequencies can be analyzed using a Bayesian
                   statistical approach to reliably detect and quantify
                   the degree of rotational diffusion anisotropy. Our
                   approach differs from previous methods in that it does
                   not make assumptions concerning the internal motions
                   experienced by the residues which are used to quantify
                   the diffusion anisotropy, but rather averages the
                   results over all internal motions consistent with the
                   data. We demonstrate our method using synthetic data
                   corresponding to isotropic, axially symmetric
                   anisotropic, and fully asymmetric anisotropic
                   rotational diffusion, as well as experimental NMR data.
                   We compare the Bayesian statistical approach with a
                   widely used method for extracting tumbling parameters
                   using both synthetic and experimental data. While it
                   can be difficult to separate the effects of chemical
                   exchange from rotational anisotropy using this
                   "standard" method, these effects are readily separated
                   using Bayesian statistics. In addition, we find that
                   the Bayesian statistical approach requires considerably
                   less CPU time than an equivalent standard analysis.},

  abstract       = {In order to analyze NMR relaxation data in terms of
                   parameters which describe internal motion, one must
                   first obtain a description of the overall tumbling of
                   the macromolecule in solution. Methods currently used
                   to estimate these global parameters may not always
                   provide reliable estimates of their values and
                   uncertainties. In this paper, we present a general data
                   analysis formalism based on products of Bayesian
                   marginal probability densities which can be used to
                   efficiently combine the information content from
                   multiple experiments, such as R(1), R(2), and NOE data
                   collected at multiple magnetic field strengths, or data
                   from cross-correlation or rotating frame relaxation
                   dispersion experiments. Our approach allows the
                   estimation of global tumbling and internal dynamical
                   parameters and their uncertainties without some of the
                   assumptions which are made in the commonly-used methods
                   for model-selection and global parameter estimation.
                   Compared to an equivalent classical statistical
                   approach, the Bayesian method not only is more
                   computationally efficient, but also provides greater
                   insight into the information content of the data. We
                   demonstrate that this approach can be used to estimate
                   both the isotropic rotational correlation time in the

  abstract       = {Olfactory marker protein (OMP) is a ubiquitous,
                   cytoplasmic protein found in mature olfactory receptor
                   neurons of all vertebrates. Electrophysiological and
                   behavioral studies demonstrate that it is a modulator
                   of the olfactory signal transduction pathway. Here, we
                   demonstrate that the solution structure of OMP, as
                   determined by NMR studies, is a single globular domain
                   protein comprised of eight beta-strands forming two
                   beta-sheets oriented orthogonally to one another, thus
                   exhibiting a "beta-clam" or "beta-sandwich" fold:
                   beta-sheet 1 is comprised of beta3-beta8-beta1-beta2
                   and beta-sheet 2 contains beta6-beta5-beta4-beta7.
                   Insertions include two, long alpha-helices located on
                   opposite sides of the beta-clam and three flexible
                   loops. The juxtaposition of beta-strands
                   beta6-beta5-beta4-beta7-beta2-beta1-beta8-beta3 forms a
                   continuously curved surface and encloses one side of
                   the beta-clam. The "cleft" formed by the two
                   beta-sheets is opposite to the closed end of the
                   beta-clam. Using a peptide titration series, we have
                   identified this cleft as the binding surface for a
                   peptide derived from the Bex1 protein. The highly
                   conserved Omega-loop structure adjacent to the Bex1
                   peptide-binding surface found in OMP may be the site of
                   additional OMP-protein interactions related to its role
                   in modulating olfactory signal transduction. Thus, the
                   interaction between the OMP and Bex1 proteins could
                   facilitate the interaction between OMP and other
                   components of the olfactory signaling pathway.},

                   through S81, with order parameters (S2) in the 0.5-0.6
                   range. The anisotropy observed in the motion of the two
                   globular calmodulin domains is much smaller than
                   expected on the basis of hydrodynamic calculations for
                   a rigid dumbbell type structure. This indicates that,
                   for the purposes of 15N relaxation, the tumbling of the
                   N-terminal (L4-K77) and C-terminal (E82-S147) lobes of
                   calmodulin is effectively independent. A slightly
                   shorter motional correlation time (tau c approximately
                   6.3 ns) is obtained for the C-terminal domain compared
                   to the N-terminal domain (tau c approximately 7.1 ns),
                   in agreement with the smaller size of the C-terminal
                   domain. A high degree of mobility, with order
                   parameters of approximately 0.5, is also observed in
                   the loop that connects the first with the second
                   EF-hand type calcium binding domain and in the loop
                   connecting the third and fourth calcium binding domain.},

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is an excellent tool for studying protein dynamics at atomic resolution. Analysis of relaxation data using model-free analysis can be a tedious and time consuming process, which requires good knowledge of scripting procedures. The software relaxGUI was developed for fast and simple model-free analysis and is fully integrated into the software package relax. It is written in Python and uses wxPython to build the graphical user interface (GUI) for maximum performance and multi-platform use. This software allows the analysis of NMR relaxation data with ease and the generation of publication quality graphs as well as color coded images of molecular structures. The interface is designed for simple data analysis and management. The software was tested and validated against the command line version of relax.},

                   transcription factor GCN4 consists of a C-terminal
                   leucine zipper and an N-terminal basic DNA-binding
                   region that achieves a stable structure only after
                   association with DNA. Backbone dynamics of a peptide
                   encompassing the basic and leucine zipper bZip domain
                   (residues 226-281) are described using NMR
                   spectroscopy. The 15N longitudinal relaxation rates,
                   15N transverse relaxation rates, and inverted question
                   mark1H inverted question mark-15N nuclear Overhauser
                   effects were measured for the backbone amide nitrogen
                   atoms at 290 K, 300 K, and 310 K. The relaxation data
                   were interpreted using reduced spectral density mapping
                   to determine values of the spectral density function,
                   J(omega), at the frequencies 0, omegaN, and 0.87omegaH
                   to characterize overall and intramolecular motions on
                   picosecond-nanosecond timescales. To account for the
                   temperature dependence of overall rotational diffusion,
                   the J(0) values were normalized using Stoke's Law. At
                   310 K, the 13Calpha and 13CO chemical shifts in
                   conjunction with the spectral density values indicate
                   that the leucine zipper sequence forms a highly ordered
                   alpha-helix, while the basic region populates an
                   ensemble of highly dynamic transient structures with
                   substantial helical character. The normalized values of
                   J(0) and the values of J(0.87omegaH) for residues in
                   the leucine zipper dimerization domain are independent
                   of temperature. In contrast, residues in the basic
                   region exhibit pronounced increases in the normalized
                   J(0) and decreases in J(0.87omegaH) as temperature is
                   decreased. A strong correlation exists between the
                   temperature dependence of 13CO chemical shifts and of
                   J(0.87omegaH). These results suggest that, for the
                   basic region, lowering the temperature increases the
                   population of transient helical conformations, and
                   concomitantly reduces the amplitude or timescale of
                   conformational fluctuations on picosecond-nanosecond
                   timescales. Changes in the conformational dynamics of
                   the peptide backbone of the basic region that accompany
                   DNA binding contribute to the overall thermodynamics of
                   complex formation. The change in backbone
                   conformational entropy derived from NMR spin-relaxation
                   data agrees well with the result calculated from
                   calorimetric measurements. Restriction of the
                   conformational space accessible to the basic region may
                   significantly reduce the entropic cost associated with
                   formation of the basic region helices consequent to DNA
                   binding.},

                   interproton distances derived from homonuclear
                   cross-relaxation experiments. Information about short

                   of model-based data analysis and a strategy for the
                   analysis of empirical data. Model selection, under the
                   information theoretic approach presented here, attempts
                   to identify the (likely) best model, orders the models
                   from best to worst, and measures the plausibility
                   ("calibration") that each model is really the best as
                   an inference. Model selection methods are extended to
                   allow inference from more than a single "best" model.
                   Several methods are given that allow the uncertainty as
                   to which model is "best" to be incorporated into
                   estimates of precision. An array of examples are given
                   to illustrate various technical issues. This is an
                   applied book written primarily for biologists and
                   statisticians using models for making inferences from
                   empirical data. Research biologists working either in
                   the field or in the laboratory will find simple methods
                   that are likely to be useful in their investigations.
                   Applied statisticians will find the information
                   theoretic methods presented here quite useful and a
                   superior alternative, especially for observational
                   studies. People interested in the empirical sciences
                   will find this material useful as it offers an

                   (15)N nuclear magnetic spin relaxation.
                   Laboratory-frame relaxation data acquired at 310 K and
                   at static magnetic field strengths of 11.7, 14.1 and
                   18.8 T are analysed using reduced spectral density
                   mapping and model-free approaches. Chemical exchange
                   line broadening is characterized using Hahn-echo
                   transverse and multiple quantum relaxation data
                   acquired over a temperature range of 290-320 K and at a
                   static magnetic field strength of 14.1 T. Results for
                   ttRNH(*) are compared to previously published data for
                   a mesophilic homologue, Escherichia coli ribonuclease
                   HI (ecRNH). Intramolecular conformational fluctuations
                   on the picosecond-to-nanosecond time scale generally
                   are similar for ttRNH(*) and ecRNH. beta-Strands 3 and
                   5 and the glycine-rich region are more rigid while the
                   substrate-binding handle region and C-terminal tail are
                   more flexible in ttRNH(*) than in ecRNH. Rigidity in
                   the two beta-strands and the glycine-rich region,
                   located along the periphery of the central beta-sheet,
                   may be associated with the increased thermodynamic
                   stability of the thermophilic enzyme. Chemical exchange
                   line broadening, reflecting microsecond-to-millisecond
                   time scale conformational changes, is more pronounced
                   in ttRNH(*) than in ecRNH, particularly for residues in
                   the handle and surrounding the catalytic site. The
                   temperature dependence of chemical exchange show an
                   increase of approximately 15 kJ/mol in the apparent
                   activation energies for ttRNH(*) residues in the handle
                   compared to ecRNH. Increased activation barriers,
                   coupled with motion between alpha-helices B and C not
                   present in ecRNH, may be associated with the reduced
                   catalytic activity of the thermophilic enzyme at 310 K.},

                   relaxation measurements has been examined using
                   artificial amide (15)N relaxation data sets generated
                   from a 10 nanosecond molecular dynamics trajectory of a
                   dihydrofolate reductase ternary complex in explicit
                   water. With access to a detailed picture of the
                   underlying internal motions, the efficacy of model-free
                   analysis and impact of model selection protocols on the
                   interpretation of NMR data can be studied. In the limit
                   of uncorrelated global tumbling and internal motions,
                   fitting the relaxation data to the model-free models
                   can recover a significant amount of quantitative
                   information on the internal dynamics. Despite a slight
                   overestimation, the generalized order parameter is
                   quite accurately determined. However, the model-free
                   analysis appears to be insensitive to the presence of
                   nanosecond time scale motions with relatively small
                   magnitude. For such cases, the effective correlation
                   time can be significantly underestimated. As a result,
                   proteins appear to be more rigid than they really are.
                   The model selection protocols have a major impact on
                   the information one can reliably obtain. The commonly
                   employed protocol based on step-up hypothesis testing
                   has severe drawbacks of oversimplification and
                   underfitting. The consequences are that the order
                   parameter is more severely overestimated and the
                   correlation time more severely underestimated. Instead,
                   model selection based on Bayesian Information Criteria
                   (BIC), recently introduced to the model-free analysis
                   by d'Auvergne and Gooley (2003), provides a better
                   balance between bias and variance. More appropriate
                   models can be selected, leading to improved estimate of
                   both the order parameter and correlation time. In
                   addition, the computational cost is significantly
                   reduced and subjective parameters such as the
                   significance level are unnecessary.},

                   interleukin-1 beta are investigated by using
                   two-dimensional inverse detected heteronuclear 15N-1H
                   NMR spectroscopy. 15N T1, T2, and NOE data at a
                   spectrometer frequency of 600 MHz are obtained for 90\%
                   of the backbone amide groups. The data provide evidence
                   for motions on three time scales. All the residues
                   exhibit very fast motions on a time scale of
                   approximately less than 20-50 ps that can be
                   characterized by a single-order parameter with an
                   average value of 0.82 +/- 0.05. For a model comprising
                   free diffusion within a cone, these residue-specific
                   order parameters translate to an average cone semiangle
                   of 20.7 +/- 3.3 degrees. Thirty-two residues also
                   display motions on a time scale of 0.5-4 ns, slightly
                   less than the overall rotational correlation time of
                   the protein (8.3 ns). These additional motions must be
                   invoked to account for the discrepancy between
                   experiment and the simplest theoretical formulation in
                   which the internal motions are described by only two
                   parameters, a generalized order parameter and an
                   effective correlation time [Lipari, G., \& Szabo, A.
                   (1982a) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 104, 4546-4559]. In
                   particular, while the simple formulation can account
                   for the 15N T1 and T2 data, it fails to account for the
                   15N-1H NOE data and yields calculated values for the
                   NOEs that are either too small or negative, whereas the
                   observed NOEs are positive. With the introduction of
                   two internal motions that are faster than the
                   rotational correlation time and differ in time scales
                   by at least 1-2 orders of magnitude [Clore, G. M.,
                   Szabo, A., Bax, A., Kay, L. E., Driscoll, P. C., \&
                   Gronenborn, A. M. (1990) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 112,
                   4989-4991], all the relaxation data for these 32
                   residues can be fitted by two order parameters and an
                   effective correlation time for the slower of the two
                   internal motions. A simple model for these two motions
                   is one in which the very fast motion involves axially
                   symmetric diffusion within a cone, while the slower
                   motion comprises jumps between two different
                   orientations of the NH vector. For such a model the
                   jump angle (excluding the C-terminal residue) ranges
                   from 15 degrees to 69 degrees with a mean value of 28.6
                   +/- 14.0 degrees. Another 42 residues are characterized
                   by some sort of motion on the 30-ns-10-ms time scale,
                   which results in 15N line broadening due to chemical
                   exchange between different conformational substates
                   with distinct 15N chemical shifts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

                   cytochrome c2 have been determined using heteronuclear
                   NMR spectroscopy. In all, 1204 NOE-derived distances
                   were used in the structure calculation to give a final
                   ensemble with 0.59(+/-0.08) A rms deviation for the
                   backbone atoms (C, Calpha and N) with respect to the
                   mean coordinates. There is no major difference between
                   the solution structure and the previously solved X-ray
                   crystal structure (1.07(+/-0.07) A rms difference for
                   the backbone atoms), although certain significant local
                   structural differences have been identified. This
                   protein contains five helical regions and a
                   histidine-heme binding domain, connected by a series of
                   structured loops. The orientation of the helices
                   provides an excellent sampling of angular space and
                   thus allows a precise characterization of the
                   anisotropic diffusion tensor. Analysis of the
                   hydrodynamics of the protein has been performed by
                   interpretation of the 15N relaxation data using
                   isotropic, axially asymmetric and fully anisotropic
                   diffusion tensors. The protein can be shown to exhibit
                   significant anisotropic reorientation with a diffusion
                   tensor with principal axes values of
                   1.405(+/-0.031)x10(7) s-1, 1.566(+/-0.051)x10(7) s-1
                   and 1.829(+/-0.054)x10(7) s-1. Hydrodynamic
                   calculations performed on the solution structure
                   predict values of 1.399x10(7) s-1, 1.500x10(7) s-1 and
                   1.863x10(7) s-1 when a solvent shell of 3.5 A is
                   included in the calculation. The optimal orientation of
                   the diffusion tensor has been incorporated into a
                   hybrid Lipari-Szabo type local motion-anisotropic
                   rotational diffusion model to characterize the local
                   mobility in the molecule. The mobility parameters thus
                   extracted show a quantitative improvement with respect
                   to the model-free analysis assuming isotropic
                   reorientation; helical regions exhibit similar dynamic
                   properties and fewer residues require more complex
                   models of internal motion. While the molecule is
                   essentially rigid, a tripeptide loop region (residues
                   101 to 103) exhibits flexibility in the range of 20 to
                   30 ps, which appears to be correlated with the order in
                   the NMR solution structure.},

                   widely used for the study of protein dynamics, consists
                   of the separation of the global rotational diffusion
                   from internal motions relative to the diffusion frame
                   and the description of these internal motions by
                   amplitude and timescale. Five model-free models exist,
                   each of which describes a different type of motion.
                   Model-free analysis requires the selection of the model
                   which best describes the dynamics of the NH bond. It
                   will be demonstrated that the model selection technique
                   currently used has two significant flaws,
                   under-fitting, and not selecting a model when one ought
                   to be selected. Under-fitting breaks the principle of
                   parsimony causing bias in the final model-free results,
                   visible as an overestimation of S2 and an
                   underestimation of taue and Rex. As a consequence the
                   protein falsely appears to be more rigid than it
                   actually is. Model selection has been extensively
                   developed in other fields. The techniques known as
                   Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC), small sample size
                   corrected AIC (AICc), Bayesian Information Criteria
                   (BIC), bootstrap methods, and cross-validation will be
                   compared to the currently used technique. To analyse
                   the variety of techniques, synthetic noisy data
                   covering all model-free motions was created. The data
                   consists of two types of three-dimensional grid, the
                   Rex grids covering single motions with chemical
                   exchange [S2,taue,Rex], and the Double Motion grids
                   covering two internal motions [S f 2,S s 2,tau s ]. The
                   conclusion of the comparison is that for accurate
                   model-free results, AIC model selection is essential.
                   As the method neither under, nor over-fits, AIC is the
                   best tool for applying Occam's razor and has the
                   additional benefits of simplifying and speeding up
                   model-free analysis.},

  abstract       = {Model-free analysis is a technique commonly used
                   within the field of NMR spectroscopy to extract atomic
                   resolution, interpretable dynamic information on
                   multiple timescales from the R (1), R (2), and steady
                   state NOE. Model-free approaches employ two disparate
                   areas of data analysis, the discipline of mathematical
                   optimisation, specifically the minimisation of a chi(2)
                   function, and the statistical field of model selection.
                   By searching through a large number of model-free
                   minimisations, which were setup using synthetic
                   relaxation data whereby the true underlying dynamics is
                   known, certain model-free models have been identified
                   to, at times, fail. This has been characterised as
                   either the internal correlation times, tau( e ), tau( f
                   ), or tau( s ), or the global correlation time
                   parameter, local tau( m ), heading towards infinity,
                   the result being that the final parameter values are
                   far from the true values. In a number of cases the
                   minimised chi(2) value of the failed model is
                   significantly lower than that of all other models and,
                   hence, will be the model which is chosen by model
                   selection techniques. If these models are not removed
                   prior to model selection the final model-free results
                   could be far from the truth. By implementing a series
                   of empirical rules involving inequalities these models
                   can be specifically isolated and removed. Model-free
                   analysis should therefore consist of three distinct
                   steps: model-free minimisation, model-free model
                   elimination, and finally model-free model selection.
                   Failure has also been identified to affect the
                   individual Monte Carlo simulations used within error
                   analysis. Each simulation involves an independent
                   randomised relaxation data set and model-free
                   minimisation, thus simulations suffer from exactly the
                   same types of failure as model-free models. Therefore,
                   to prevent these outliers from causing a significant
                   overestimation of the errors the failed Monte Carlo
                   simulations need to be culled prior to calculating the
                   parameter standard deviations.},

                   intricately linked to the Brownian rotational diffusion
                   of the macromolecule. The diffusion tensor parameters
                   strongly influence the optimisation of the various
                   model-free models and the subsequent model selection
                   between them. Finding the optimal model of the dynamics
                   of the system among the numerous diffusion and
                   model-free models is hence quite complex. Using set
                   theory, the entirety of this global problem has been
                   encapsulated by the universal set Ll, and its
                   resolution mathematically formulated as the universal
                   solution Ll. Ever since the original Lipari and Szabo
                   papers the model-free dynamics of a molecule has most
                   often been solved by initially estimating the diffusion
                   tensor. The model-free models which depend on the
                   diffusion parameter values are then optimised and the
                   best model is chosen to represent the dynamics of the
                   residue. Finally, the global model of all diffusion and
                   model-free parameters is optimised. These steps are
                   repeated until convergence. For simplicity this
                   approach to Ll will be labelled the diffusion seeded
                   model-free paradigm. Although this technique suffers
                   from a number of problems many have been solved. All
                   aspects of the diffusion seeded paradigm and its
                   consequences, together with a few alternatives to the

                   dynamics of a macromolecule is the optimisation of the
                   model-free and Brownian rotational diffusion parameters
                   using the collected R (1), R (2) and steady-state NOE
                   relaxation data. The problem of optimising the
                   chi-squared value is often assumed to be trivial,
                   however, the long chain of dependencies required for
                   its calculation complicates the model-free chi-squared
                   space. Convolutions are induced by the Lorentzian form
                   of the spectral density functions, the linear
                   recombinations of certain spectral density values to
                   obtain the relaxation rates, the calculation of the NOE
                   using the ratio of two of these rates, and finally the
                   quadratic form of the chi-squared equation itself. Two
                   major topological features of the model-free space
                   complicate optimisation. The first is a long, shallow
                   valley which commences at infinite correlation times
                   and gradually approaches the minimum. The most severe
                   convolution occurs for motions on two timescales in
                   which the minimum is often located at the end of a
                   long, deep, curved tunnel or multidimensional valley
                   through the space. A large number of optimisation
                   algorithms will be investigated and their performance
                   compared to determine which techniques are suitable for
                   use in model-free analysis. Local optimisation
                   algorithms will be shown to be sufficient for
                   minimisation not only within the model-free space but
                   also for the minimisation of the Brownian rotational
                   diffusion tensor. In addition the performance of the
                   programs Modelfree and Dasha are investigated. A number
                   of model-free optimisation failures were identified:
                   the inability to slide along the limits, the singular
                   matrix failure of the Levenberg-Marquardt minimisation
                   algorithm, the low precision of both programs, and a
                   bug in Modelfree. Significantly, the singular matrix
                   failure of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm occurs
                   when internal correlation times are undefined and is
                   greatly amplified in model-free analysis by both the
                   grid search and constraint algorithms. The program
                   relax ( http://www.nmr-relax.com ) is also presented as

                   the procedure repeated until convergence. In this paper
                   a new methodology is presented which takes a different
                   approach to this diffusion seeded model-free paradigm.
                   Rather than starting with the diffusion tensor this
                   iterative protocol begins by optimising the model-free
                   parameters in the absence of any global model
                   parameters, selecting between all the model-free
                   models, and finally optimising the diffusion tensor.
                   The new model-free optimisation protocol will be
                   validated using synthetic data from Schurr JM et al.
                   (1994) J Magn Reson B 105(3), 211-224 and the
                   relaxation data of the bacteriorhodopsin (1-36)BR
                   fragment from Orekhov VY (1999) J Biomol NMR 14(4),
                   345-356. To demonstrate the importance of this new
                   procedure the NMR relaxation data of the Olfactory

                   44(28), 9673-9679 is reanalysed. The result is that the

                   very different from those originally reported.},

                   interpretation of 15N relaxation rates in terms of
                   macromolecular anisotropic rotational diffusion. The
                   program is based on a highly efficient simulated
                   annealing/minimization algorithm, designed specifically
                   to search the parametric space described by the
                   isotropic, axially symmetric and fully anisotropic
                   rotational diffusion tensor models. The high efficiency
                   of this algorithm allows extensive noise-based Monte
                   Carlo error analysis. Relevant statistical tests are
                   systematically applied to provide confidence limits for
                   the proposed tensorial models. The program is
                   illustrated here using the example of the cytochrome c'

                   philosopher of science now writing about probabilistic
                   inference has been influenced by Edwards' book, and his
                   ideas are now as alive and relevant as they were when
                   the book first appeared. Edwards is an absolutely
                   seminal thinker in the foundations of statistics and
                   scientific inference."--Elliott Sober, University of
                   Wisconsin-Madison. "Full of appropriate examples
                   (especially from genetics) and historical commentary,
                   this monograph offers a rare simultaneous treatment of
                   both mathematical and philosophical foundations."--
                   American Mathematical Monthly. This new and expanded
                   edition of A. W. F. Edwards' classic volume on
                   scientific inference presents his most important
                   published articles on the subject. Edwards argues that
                   the appropriate axiomatic basis for inductive inference
                   is not that of probability, with its addition axiom,
                   but that of likelihood, the concept introduced by
                   Fisher as a measure of relative support among different
                   hypotheses. Starting from the simplest considerations
                   and assuming no more than a basic acquaintancewith
                   probability theory, the author sets out to reconstruct
                   a consistent theory of statistical inference in
                   science. Using the likelihood approach, he explores
                   estimation, tests of significance, randomization,
                   experimental design, and other statistical topics.
                   Likelihood is important reading for students and
                   professionals in biology, mathematical sciences, and
                   philosophy. "This book is commended to all philosophers
                   of science who are interested in the problems of
                   scientific inference."-- Search. "This book, by a
                   well-known geneticist, will do much to publicize the
                   generality of the likelihood method as a foundation for
                   statistical procedure. It is both smoothly written and
                   persuasive."-- Operations Research. " Likelihood is an
                   important text and, in addition, is a joy to read,
                   being a paragon of lucid and witty exposition."--

Abstract = {{The dynamics of the glycosidic bond of lactose was studied by a
   paramagnetic tagging-based NMR technique, which allowed the collection
   of an unusually large series of NMR data for a single compound. By the
   use of distance-and orientation-dependent residual dipolar couplings and
   pseudocontact shifts, the simultaneous fitting of the probabilities of
   computed conformations and the orientation of the magnetic
   susceptibility tensor of a series of lanthanide complexes of lactose
   show that its glycosidic bond samples syn/syn, anti/syn and syn/anti
   phi/psi regions of the conformational space in water. The analysis
   indicates a higher reliability of pseudocontact shift data as compared
   to residual dipolar couplings with the presently available weakly
   orienting paramagnetic tagging technique. The method presented herein
   allows for an improved understanding of the dynamic behaviour of
   oligosaccharides.}},

  abstract       = {The backbone dynamics of the C-terminal SH2 domain of
                   phospholipase C gamma 1 have been investigated. Two
                   forms of the domain were studied, one in complex with a
                   high-affinity binding peptide derived from the
                   platelet-derived growth factor receptor and the other
                   in the absence of this peptide. 2-D 1H-15N NMR methods,
                   employing pulsed field gradients, were used to
                   determine steady-state 1H-15N NOE values and T1 and T2
                   15N relaxation times. Backbone dynamics were
                   characterized by the overall correlation time (tau m),
                   order parameters (S2), effective correlation times for
                   internal motions (tau e), and, if required, terms to
                   account for motions on a
                   microsecond-to-millisecond-time scale. An extended
                   two-time-scale formalism was used for residues having
                   relaxation data and that could not be fit adequately
                   using a single-time-scale formalism. The overall
                   correlation times of the uncomplexed and complexed
                   forms of SH2 were found to be 9.2 and 6.5 ns,
                   respectively, suggesting that the uncomplexed form is
                   in a monomer-dimer equilibrium. This was subsequently
                   confirmed by hydrodynamic measurements. Analysis of
                   order parameters reveals that residues in the so-called
                   phosphotyrosine-binding loop exhibited higher than
                   average disorder in both forms of SH2. Although
                   localized differences in order parameters were observed
                   between the uncomplexed and complexed forms of SH2,
                   overall, higher order parameters were not found in the
                   peptide-bound form, indicating that on average,
                   picosecond-time-scale disorder is not reduced upon
                   binding peptide. The relaxation data of the
                   SH2-phosphopeptide complex were fit with fewer exchange
                   terms than the uncomplexed form. This may reflect the
                   monomer-dimer equilibrium that exists in the
                   uncomplexed form or may indicate that the complexed
                   form has lower conformational flexibility on a
                   microsecond-to-millisecond-time scale.},

                   the dynamics of amide bond vectors from N-15 relaxation
                   parameters alone. Assuming that the spectral density is
                   given by the sum of Lorentzian functions, the approach
                   allows values of J(omega) to be obtained at omega=0,
                   omega(N), and 0.870 omega(H), where omega(N) and
                   omega(H) are Larmor frequencies of nitrogen and proton
                   nuclei, respectively, from measurements of N-15 T-1,
                   T-2 and H-1-N-15 steady-state NOE values at a single
                   spectrometer frequency. Alternatively, when
                   measurements are performed at two different
                   spectrometer frequencies of i and j MHz, J(omega) can
                   be mapped at omega=0, omega(N)(i), omega(N)(j), 0.870
                   omega(H)(i) and 0.870 omega Hj, where omega Ni, for
                   example, is the N-15 Larmor frequency for a
                   spectrometer operating at i MHz. Additionally,
                   measurements made at two different spectrometer
                   frequencies enable contributions to transverse
                   relaxation from motions on millisecond-microsecond time
                   scales to be evaluated and permit assessment of whether
                   a description of the internal dynamics is consistent
                   with a correlation function describing the dynamics of
                   the N-15-NH bond vector are necessary, provided that
                   dJ(omega)/d omega is relatively constant between
                   omega=omega(H) + omega(N) to omega=omega(H)-omega(N).
                   Simulations demonstrate that the method is accurate for
                   a wide range of protein motions and correlation times,

                   microM, and by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The
                   analysis was performed using the model-free approach.
                   The method was extended in order to account for
                   observed partial (equilibrium) dimerization of the
                   protein at NMR concentrations. A model is developed
                   that takes into account both rapid monomer-dimer
                   exchange and anisotropy of the over-all rotation of the
                   dimer. The data show complex dynamics of the dynamin PH
                   domain. Internal motions in elements of the secondary
                   structure are restricted, as inferred from the high
                   value of the order parameter (S2 approximately 0.9) and
                   from the local correlation time < 100 ps. Of the four
                   extended loop regions that are disordered in the
                   NMR-derived solution structure of the protein, loops
                   beta 1/beta 2 and beta 5/beta 6 are involved in a
                   large-amplitude (S2 down to 0.2 to 0.3) subnanosecond
                   to nanosecond time-scale motion. Reorientation of the
                   loops beta 3/beta 4 and beta 6/beta 7, in contrast, is
                   restricted, characterized by the values of order
                   parameter S2 approximately 0.9 more typical of the
                   protein core. These loops, however, are involved in
                   much slower processes of motion resulting in a
                   conformational exchange on a microsecond to
                   submillisecond time scale. The motions of the terminal
                   regions (residues 1 to 10, 122 to 125) are practically
                   unrestricted (S2 down to 0.05, characteristic times in
                   nanosecond time scale), suggesting that these parts of
                   the sequence do not participate in the protein fold.
                   The analysis shows a larger sensitivity of the 15N
                   relaxation data to protein microdynamic parameters (S2,
                   tau loc) when protein molecular mass (tau c) increases.

                   NOEs as an indicator of the residues not belonging to
                   the folded structure is suggested. The amplitudes of
                   local motion observed in the MD simulation are in a
                   good-agreement with the NMR data for the amide NH
                   groups located in the protein core.},

  abstract       = {The N-terminal domain (residues 1 to 90) of chicken
                   skeletal troponin C (NTnC) regulates muscle contraction
                   upon the binding of a calcium ion to each of its two
                   calcium binding loops. In order to characterize the
                   backbone dynamics of NTnC in the apo state (NTnC-apo),
                   we measured and carefully analyzed 15N NMR relaxation
                   parameters T1, T2 and NOE at 1H NMR frequencies of 500
                   and 600 MHz. The overall rotational correlation time of
                   NTnC-apo at 29.6 degrees C is 4.86 (+/-0.15) ns. The
                   experimental data indicate that the rotational
                   diffusion of NTnC-apo is anisotropic with a diffusion
                   anisotropy, D parallel/D perpendicular, of 1.10.
                   Additionally, the dynamic properties of side-chains
                   having a methyl group were derived from 2H relaxation
                   data of CH2D groups of a partially deuterated
                   sample.Based on the dynamic characteristics of TnC, two
                   different levels of "fine tuning" of the calcium
                   affinity are presented. Significantly lower backbone
                   order parameters (S2), were observed for calcium
                   binding site I relative to site II and the contribution
                   of the bond vector fluctuations to the conformational
                   entropy of sites I and II was calculated. The
                   conformational entropy loss due to calcium binding
                   (DeltaDeltaSp) differs by 1 kcal/mol between sites I
                   and II. This is consistent with the different
                   dissociation constants previously measured for sites I
                   and II of 16 microM and 1. 7 microM, respectively.In
                   addition to the direct role of binding loop dynamics,
                   the side-chain methyl group dynamics play an indirect
                   role through the energetics of the calcium-induced
                   structural change from a closed to an open state. Our
                   results show that the side-chains which will be exposed
                   upon calcium binding have reduced motion in the apo
                   state, suggesting that conformational entropic
                   contributions can be used to offset the free energy
                   cost of exposing hydrophobic groups. It is clear from
                   this work that a complete determination of their
                   dynamic characteristics is necessary in order to fully
                   understand how TnC and other proteins are fine tuned to
                   appropriately carry out their function.},

                   Ada protein (N-Ada10) repairs methyl phosphotriesters
                   in DNA and possesses a tightly bound zinc ion. The
                   complete resonance assignments of this protein domain
                   have been obtained using multidimensional homonuclear
                   and heteronuclear NMR experiments. The assignments
                   served to study the internal mobility of this protein
                   domain via 15N relaxation experiments. This involved
                   the measurement of longitudinal and transverse 15N
                   relaxation rates, as well as the amide proton solvent
                   exchange rates. Relaxation rates in the rotating frame,
                   R1 rho, of 15N nuclei were measured at different
                   spin-lock field strengths, leading to the detection of
                   two slow conformational exchange processes at Gly-25
                   and Gln-73. For the latter, which is next to the active
                   site of this protein domain, the characteristic time of
                   this process was found to be around 60 microseconds.
                   The other relaxation experiments unveiled some regions
                   of fast internal motions, faster than the overall
                   correlation time. These motions were found in the N-
                   and C- terminal tails, in segment 33-35 which forms the
                   turn between beta-strands S1 and S2, and residues 47-52
                   located in a long loop preceding strand S3. The latter
                   loop belongs to the potential DNA binding surface of
                   N-Ada10. While the structure from residue 18 to residue
                   26 appears not well defined in the calculated
                   structure, the relaxation experiments do not indicate
                   higher mobility for this region. Residues at the
                   N-terminal portion, including the first helix, the
                   sequentially adjacent loop, and part of the second
                   helix, exhibit internal motions close to the time scale
                   of the overall rotational correlation time. This
                   appears to be related to the fact that the first helix
                   has no hydrogen bonds or salt bridges to the rest of
                   the protein and is stabilized only by the involvement
                   of some of its side chains in a hydrophobic core
                   consisting of the side chains of two phenylalanines, a
                   tryptophan, a leucine, and a valine. The four cysteines
                   which bind the zinc show motions on different time
                   scales ranging from microseconds to picoseconds. Thus
                   the motions in the immediate region around the bound
                   zinc of the DNA methyl phosphotriester repair domain
                   are of relatively small amplitude but take place over a
                   wide time range. On the other hand, high mobility is
                   found in the turn connecting S1 and S2 and in the loop
                   preceding S3, regions of the potential DNA binding
                   surface.},

  abstract       = {We have determined the structure of the reduced form
                   of the DsbA oxidoreductase from Vibrio cholerae. The
                   reduced structure shows a high level of similarity to
                   the crystal structure of the oxidized form and is
                   typical of this class of enzyme containing a
                   thioredoxin domain with an inserted alpha-helical
                   domain. Proteolytic and thermal stability measurements
                   show that the reduced form of DsbA is considerably more
                   stable than the oxidized form. NMR relaxation data have
                   been collected and analyzed using a model-free approach
                   to probe the dynamics of the reduced and oxidized
                   states of DsbA. Akaike's information criteria have been
                   applied both in the selection of the model-free models
                   and the diffusion tensors that describe the global
                   motions of each redox form. Analysis of the dynamics
                   reveals that the oxidized protein shows increased
                   disorder on the pico- to nanosecond and micro- to
                   millisecond timescale. Many significant changes in
                   dynamics are located either close to the active site or
                   at the insertion points between the domains. In
                   addition, analysis of the diffusion data shows there is
                   a clear difference in the degree of interdomain
                   movement between oxidized and reduced DsbA with the
                   oxidized form being the more rigid. Principal
                   components analysis has been employed to indicate
                   possible concerted movements in the DsbA structure,
                   which suggests that the modeled interdomain motions
                   affect the catalytic cleft of the enzyme. Taken
                   together, these data provide compelling evidence of a
                   role for dynamics in the catalytic cycle of DsbA.},

                   data using the Lipari-Szabo model-free formalism. The
                   graphical approach is advantageous in that it allows
                   the direct visualization of the experimental
                   uncertainties in the motional parameter space. Some
                   general 'rules' describing the relationship between the
                   precision of the relaxation measurements and the
                   precision of the model-free parameters and how this
                   relationship changes with the overall tumbling time
                   (tau m) are summarized. The effect of the precision in
                   the relaxation measurements on the detection of
                   internal motions not close to the extreme narrowing
                   limit is analyzed. We also show that multiple timescale
                   internal motions may be obscured by experimental
                   uncertainty, and that the collection of relaxation data
                   at very high field strength can improve the ability to
                   detect such deviations from the simple Lipari-Szabo

  abstract       = {This paper describes the use of novel two-dimensional
                   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) pulse sequences to
                   provide insight into protein dynamics. The sequences
                   developed permit the measurement of the relaxation
                   properties of individual nuclei in macromolecules,
                   thereby providing a powerful experimental approach to
                   the study of local protein mobility. For isotopically
                   labeled macromolecules, the sequences enable
                   measurements of heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser
                   effects (NOE) and spin-lattice (T1) and spin-spin (T2)
                   15N or 13C relaxation times with a sensitivity similar
                   to those of many homonuclear 1H experiments. Because T1
                   values and heteronuclear NOEs are sensitive to
                   high-frequency motions (10(8)-10(12) s-1) while T2
                   values are also a function of much slower processes, it
                   is possible to explore dynamic events occurring over a
                   large time scale. We have applied these techniques to
                   investigate the backbone dynamics of the protein
                   staphylococcal nuclease (S. Nase) complexed with
                   thymidine 3',5'-bisphosphate (pdTp) and Ca2+ and
                   labeled uniformly with 15N. T1, T2, and NOE values were
                   obtained for over 100 assigned backbone amide nitrogens
                   in the protein. Values of the order parameter (S),
                   characterizing the extent of rapid 1H-15N bond motions,
                   have been determined. These results suggest that there
                   is no correlation between these rapid small amplitude
                   motions and secondary structure for S. Nase. In
                   contrast, 15N line widths suggest a possible
                   correlation between secondary structure and motions on
                   the millisecond time scale. In particular, the loop
                   region between residues 42 and 56 appears to be
                   considerably more flexible on this slow time scale than
                   the rest of the protein.},

                   commonly used methodology of 15N relaxation data
                   analysis completely fails in detecting nanosecond time
                   scale motions if the major part of the molecule is
                   involved in these motions. New criteria are introduced
                   for the detection of such cases, based on the
                   dependence of the apparent overall correlation time,
                   derived from the T1/T2 ratio, on the spectrometer
                   frequency. Correctly estimating the overall rotation
                   correlation time tauR was shown to play the key role in
                   model-free data analysis. It is found, however, that in
                   cases of slow internal motions with characteristic
                   times of more than 3-4 ns, the effective tauR provided
                   by the T1/T2 ratio for individual amide nitrogens can
                   be used for the characterization of the fast picosecond

  abstract       = {The usual analysis of (15)N relaxation data of
                   proteins is straightforward as long as the assumption
                   can be made that the backbone of most residues only
                   undergoes fast (ps), small amplitude internal motions.
                   If this assumption cannot be made, as for example for
                   proteins which undergo domain motions or for unfolded
                   or partially folded proteins, one needs a method to
                   establish for each residue whether it undergoes fast
                   (ps) or slow (ns) internal motion. Even then it is
                   impossible to determine the correct overall tumbling
                   time, tau(m)(0), via the usual method from the ratio of
                   the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times, if
                   the majority of residues do not undergo fast, small
                   amplitude internal motions. The latter problem is
                   solved when tau(m)(0) can be determined independent of
                   the time scale, tau(i), or the amplitude, S(2), of the
                   internal motion. We propose a new protocol, called
                   PINATA, for analyzing (15)N relaxation data acquired at
                   minimally two field strengths, where no a priori
                   assumption about time scales or amplitude of internal
                   motions needs to be made, and overall tumbling can
                   either be isotropic or anisotropic. The protocol
                   involves four steps. First, for each residue, it is
                   detected whether it undergoes ps- or ns-internal
                   motion, via the combination of the ratio of the
                   longitudinal relaxation time at two fields and the
                   hetero-nuclear NOE. Second, for each residue tau(m)(0)
                   and the exchange broadening, Rex, are iteratively
                   determined. The accuracy of the determination of
                   tau(m)(0) is ca. +/-0.5 ns and of Rex ca +/- 0.7 s(-1),
                   when the relaxation data are of good quality and
                   tau(m)(0)>5 ns, S(2)>0.3, and tau(i)< approximately 3
                   ns. Third, given tau(m)(0) and Rex, step 1 is repeated
                   to iteratively improve on the internal motion and
                   obtain better estimates of the internal parameter
                   values. Fourth, final time scales and amplitudes for
                   internal motions are determined via grid search based
                   fitting and chi(2)-analysis. The protocol was
                   successfully tested on synthetic and experimental data
                   sets. The synthetic dataset mimics internal motions on
                   either fast or slow time scales, or a combination of
                   both, of either small- or large amplitude, superimposed
                   onto anisotropic overall motion. The procedures are
                   incorporated into MATLAB scripts, which are available
                   on request.},

                   distributions of orientations of N-H bond vectors are
                   not isotropic in many proteins, and correlations

  abstract       = {The DNA binding domain (residues 1--65) of the yeast
                   transcriptional activator GAL4 is only partially
                   folded. While residues 10-41, the DNA recognition
                   domain, form a well-defined structure in the free
                   protein, the whole polypeptide folds up and dimerizes
                   upon binding DNA. In order to describe the mobility of
                   the protein, we have characterized the frequency
                   spectrum of the motions of N-H bond vectors of
                   GAL4(1-65) using a reduced spectral density mapping
                   approach (an approximation of the full spectral density
                   mapping technique) [Peng, J. W., & Wagner, G. (1992a)

                   (1992b) Biochemistry 31, 8571-8586]. 15N spin-lattice
                   relaxation [Rn(Nz)], spin-spin relaxation [Rn(Nx,y)],
                   cross-relaxation [RN(Hz-->Nz)], two-spin order
                   [RNH(2HzNz)], and antiphase [RNH(2HzNx,y)] rates were
                   determined for 52 of the 65 backbone amide groups at 10
                   degrees C and ph 6.5 at 11.74 T. Calculations of the
                   spectral density functions using a reduced set of
                   RN(Nz),RN(Nx,y),RN(Hz-->Nz), and RNH(2HzNz) gave
                   excellent agreement with those calculated using all six
                   sets. The reduced method has the added advantage that
                   the errant behavior seen at high field values is
                   circumvented. A linear correlation was found between
                   J(omega N) and J(0) with a limited and clearly defined
                   range of J(0) values which defines the range of rates
                   for internal motions in GAL4(1-65). It appears that all
                   residues experience a combination of two movements: one
                   of the overall tumbling (correlation time, 8.65 ns) and
                   the other of fast internal fluctuations of the
                   structure. The respective weights of these
                   contributions vary with the primary sequence and
                   faithfully mirror the secondary and tertiary elements
                   of the protein. The position on the correlation line of
                   J(omega N) versus J(0) indicates the amount of angular
                   averaging relative to the overall motion of the
                   protein. A spectral density function for internal
                   motions can be described.},

                   N-terminal 63-residue DNA-binding domain of the 434
                   repressor has been characterized by measurements of the
                   individual 15N longitudinal relaxation times, T1,
                   transverse relaxation times, T2, and heteronuclear
                   15N[1H]-NOEs at 1H resonance frequencies of 400 and 750
                   MHz. The dependence of an apparent spherical top
                   correlation time, tauR, on the orientation of the N-H
                   bond vector with respect to the principal axes of the
                   global diffusion tensor of the protein was used to
                   establish the fact that the degree of anisotropy of the
                   global molecular tumbling amounts to 1.2, which is in
                   good agreement with the values obtained from model
                   calculations of the hydrodynamic properties. A
                   model-free analysis showed that even this small
                   anisotropy leads to the implication of artifactual slow
                   internal motions for at least two residues when the
                   assumption of isotropic global motion is used.
                   Additional residues may actually undergo internal
                   motions on the same time scale as the global rotational
                   diffusion, in which case the model-free approach would,
                   however, be inappropriate for quantifying the
                   correlation times and order parameters. Overall, the
                   experiments with 434(1-63) demonstrate that the
                   assumption of isotropic rotational reorientation may
                   result in artifacts of model-free interpretations of
                   spin relaxation data even for proteins with small
                   deviations from spherical shape.},

                   zipper domain of c-Jun have been studied using
                   proton-detected two-dimensional 1H-15N NMR
                   spectroscopy. Longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) 15N
                   relaxation times, together with \{1H\}15N NOEs, were
                   measured and analyzed by considering the protein to
                   approximate a prolate ellipsoid. An analysis of the
                   T1/T2 ratios for residues in the well-structured
                   section of the protein showed that a model for the
                   spectral density function in which the protein is
                   considered to reorient anisotropically fitted the data
                   significantly better than an isotropic model. Order
                   parameters (S2) in the range 0.7-0.9 were observed for
                   most residues, with lower values near the C-terminus,
                   consistent with fraying of the two helices comprising
                   the coiled-coil. Because nearly all of the N-H vectors
                   have small angles to the long axis of the molecule,
                   there was some uncertainty in the value of the
                   rotational diffusion coefficient Dpar, which describes
                   rotation about the long axis. Thus, an alternative
                   method was examined for its ability to provide
                   independent estimates of Dpar and Dperp (the diffusion
                   coefficient describing rotation about axes
                   perpendicular to the long axis); the transitional
                   diffusion coefficient (Dt) of the protein was measured,
                   and hydrodynamic calculations were used to predict Dpar
                   and Dperp. However, the derived rotational diffusion
                   coefficients proved to be very dependent on the
                   hydrodynamic model used to relate Dt to Dpar and Dperp,
                   and consequently the values obtained from the T1/T2
                   analysis were used in the order-paramenter analysis.
                   Although it has previously been reported that the side
                   chain of a polar residue at the dimer interface, Asn22,
                   undergoes a conformational exchange process and
                   destabilizes the dimer, no evidence of increased
                   backbone mobility in this region was detected,
                   suggesting that this process is confined to the Asn
                   side chain.},

                   variation in the characteristic temperature indicates
                   that the energy landscape, and thus the configurational
                   heat capacity, is markedly structure dependent in the
                   folded protein. The effective correlation times for
                   internal motions do not show significant temperature
                   dependence. Conformational exchange was observed for a
                   large number of residues forming a contiguous region of
                   the protein that includes the coiled coil formed by
                   helices alpha A and alpha D. Exchange broadening in the
                   CPMG experiments decreased with increased temperature,
                   directly demonstrating that the microscopic exchange
                   rate is faster than the pulse repetition rate of 1.2
                   ms. The temperature dependence of the exchange
                   contributions to the transverse relaxation rate
                   constant shows approximately Arrhenius behavior over
                   the studied temperature range with apparent activation
                   enthalpies of approximately 20-50 kJ/mol. Numerical
                   calculations suggest that these values underestimate
                   the activation barriers by at most a factor of 2. The
                   present results obtained at 300 K are compared to those
                   reported previously [Mandel, A. M., Akke, M., \&

                   RNA moiety of RNA-DNA duplex molecules. Escherichia
                   coli ribonuclease H is involved in DNA replication, and
                   retroviral ribonuclease H is essential for reverse
                   transcription of the viral genome. To characterize the
                   intramolecular dynamical properties of E. coli
                   ribonuclease H, spin-lattice relaxation rate constants,
                   spin-spin relaxation rate constants and steady state
                   nuclear Overhauser effects for the 15N nuclear spins
                   were measured by using proton-detected heteronuclear
                   NMR spectroscopy. The relaxation data were analyzed by
                   using a series of dynamical models in conjunction with
                   a statistical model selection protocol. Ribonuclease H
                   exhibits a complex array of dynamical features, most
                   notably in the parallel beta-strands of the principal
                   five-stranded beta-sheet, the coiled-coil helical
                   interface, the active site, and the loop regions
                   surrounding the active site. The dynamical properties
                   are correlated with local structural environments of
                   the 15N spins and suggest possible relationships to the
                   functional properties of ribonuclease H. Results for E.
                   coli ribonuclease H are compared to previously reported

  abstract       = {The static magnetic field dependence of chemical
                   exchange linebroadening in NMR spectroscopy is
                   investigated theoretically and experimentally. Two-site
                   exchange (A reversible arrow B) is considered with site
                   A more highly populated than site B (p(a) > p(b)), a
                   shift difference between sites equal to aw, and an
                   exchange rate constant given by k(ex). The exchange
                   contribution to the transverse relaxation rate constant
                   for the more highly populated site is denoted R-ex. The
                   dependence of R-ex,, on the static magnetic field
                   strength is characterized by a scaling parameter alpha
                   = d In R-ex/d In Delta omega in which 0 less than or
                   equal to alpha less than or equal to 2 for p(a) > 0.7.
                   The value of alpha depends on the NMR chemical shift
                   time scale for the exchange process: for slow exchange
                   (k(ex)/Delta omega < 1), 0 less than or equal to alpha
                   < 1; for intermediate exchange (k(ex)/Delta omega > 1),
                   alpha = 1 and for fast exchange (k(ex)/Delta omega >
                   1), 1 < alpha less than or equal to 2. Consequently,
                   the static magnetic field dependence of R-ex defines
                   the chemical shift time scale for an exchange process
                   even if the populations are so highly skewed (p(a) much
                   greater than p(b)) that the minor resonance is not
                   observable in the slow exchange limit. The theoretical
                   results are verified by measuring '5N transverse
                   relaxation rate constants at static magnetic fields of
                   11.7 and 14.1 T and temperatures of 300 and 313 K fur
                   the protein basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. At each
                   combination of static magnetic field and temperature,
                   the rate constants were measured using
                   Carr-Purcel-Meiboom-Gill and Hahn echo techniques with
                   spin-echo delays ranging from 1.0 to 63.5 ms. '5N
                   resonances for residues in the region of the
                   Cys14-Cys38 disulfide bond are broadened due to
                   chemical exchange. Values of a obtained from the
                   relaxation rate constants range from 0.26 +/- 0.17 for
                   Arg39 at 300 K to 1.96 +/- 0.25 for Cys38 at 313 K. For
                   Cys38 and Arg39, the two residues most strongly
                   affected by chemical exchange, values of k(ex) were
                   determined to be 380 +/- 70 s(-1) and 530 +/- 90 s(-1)
                   at 300 K and 1300 +/- 290 s(-1) and 1370 +/- 160 s(-1)
                   at 313 K by global analysis of the relaxation rate
                   constants. The scaling parameters ex indicate that
                   chemical exchange for most residues in basic pancreatic
                   trypsin inhibitor does not satisfy k(ex) /Delta omega
                   much greater than 1. Consequently, the assumption of
                   fast-limit quadratic scaling of exchange broadening in
                   proteins and other macromolecules may be incorrect,
                   even if a single broadened resonance is observed for a
                   nuclear spin. The theoretical results for the static
                   magnetic field dependence of chemical exchange
                   broadening in NMR spectroscopy are applicable to other
                   nuclei and to other techniques for measuring chemical
                   exchange Linebroadening.},

  abstract       = {The development of software for minimization problems
                   is often based on a line search method. We consider
                   line search methods that satisfy sufficient decrease
                   and curvature conditions, and formulate the problem of
                   determining a point that satisfies these two conditions
                   in terms of finding a point in a set T(mu). We describe
                   a search algorithm for this problem that produces a
                   sequence of iterates that converge to a point in T(mu)
                   and that, except for pathological cases, terminates in
                   a finite number of steps. Numerical results for an
                   implementation of the search algorithm on a set of test
                   functions show that the algorithm terminates within a
                   small number of iterations.},

                   fragment (1-36)BR solubilized in a 1:1
                   chloroform/methanol mixture were investigated by
                   heteronuclear H-1-N-15 NMR spectroscopy. The
                   heteronuclear N-15 longitudinal and transverse
                   relaxation rates and N-15\{H-1\} steady-state NOEs were
                   measured at three magnetic fields (11.7, 14.1, and 17.6
                   T). Careful statistical analysis resulted in the
                   selection of the extended model-free form of the
                   spectral density function [Clore et al. (1990) J. Am.
                   Chem. Soc., 112, 4989-4991] for all the backbone amides
                   of (1-36)BR. The peptide exhibits motions on the
                   micro-, nano-, and picosecond time scales. The dynamics
                   of the alpha-helical part of the peptide (residues
                   9-31) are characterised by nanosecond and picosecond
                   motions with mean order parameters S-s(2) = 0.60 and
                   S-f(2) = 0.84, respectively. The nanosecond motions
                   were attributed to the peptide's helix-coil transitions
                   in equilibrium. Residues 3-7 and 30-35 also exhibit
                   motions on the pico- and nanosecond time scales, but
                   with lower order parameters. Residue 10 at the
                   beginning of the alpha-helix and residues 30-35 at the
                   C-terminus are involved in conformational exchange
                   processes on the microsecond time scale. The
                   implications of the obtained results for the studies of
                   helix-coil transitions and the dynamics of membrane

                   intermediate nanosecond internal dynamics in globular
                   proteins. The procedure uses 1H-15N relaxation
                   measurements at several spectrometer frequencies and
                   hydrodynamic calculations based on experimental
                   self-diffusion coefficients. New heteronuclear
                   experiments, using pulse field gradients, are
                   introduced for the measurement of translation diffusion
                   coefficients of 15N labeled proteins. An advanced
                   interpretation of recently published (Luginbuhl et al.,
                   Biochemistry, 36, 7305-7312 (1997)) backbone amide 15N
                   relaxation data, measured at two spectrometers (400 and
                   750 MHz for 1H) for N-terminal DNA-binding domain
                   (1-63) of 434 repressor, is presented.
                   Non-applicability of commonly used fast (picosecond)
                   dynamics model (FD) was justified by (i) poor fit of
                   relaxation data by the FD model-free spectral density
                   function both for isotropic and anisotropic models of
                   the overall molecular tumbling; (ii) specific
                   dependence of the overall rotation correlation times
                   calculated from T1/T2 ratio on the spectrometer
                   frequency; (iii) mismatch of the ratio of longitudinal
                   15N relaxation times T1, measured at different
                   spectrometer frequencies, in comparison with that
                   anticipated for the FD model; (iv) significantly
                   underestimated overall rotation correlation time
                   provided by the FD model (5.50+/-0.15 and 5.80+/-0.15
                   ns for 750 and 400 MHz spectrometer frequency
                   respectively) in comparison with correlation time
                   obtained from hydrodynamics. On the other hand, all
                   relaxation and hydrodynamics data are in good
                   correspondence with the model of intermediate
                   (nanoseconds) dynamics. Overall rotation correlation
                   time of 7.5+/-0.7 ns was calculated from experimental
                   translation self-diffusion rate using hydrodynamics
                   formalism (Garcia de la Torre, J. and Bloomfield, V. A.
                   Quart. Rev. Biophys., 14, 81-139 (1981)). The
                   statistical analysis of 15N relaxation data along with
                   the hydrodynamic consideration clearly revealed that
                   most of the residues in 434(1-63) repressor are
                   involved in the nanosecond internal dynamics

                   fragments (residues 1-71 and 1-36) of bacterioopsin,
                   solubilized in two media (methanol-chloroform (1:1),
                   0.1 M (HCO2NH4)-H-2, or SDS micelles) have been
                   investigated using 2D proton-detected heteronuclear
                   H-1-N-15 NMR spectroscopy at two spectrometer
                   frequencies, 600 and 400 MHz. Contributions of the
                   conformational exchange to the transverse relaxation
                   rates of individual nitrogens were elucidated using an
                   set of different rates of the CPMG spin-lock pulse
                   train and were essentially suppressed by the
                   high-frequency CPMG spin-lock. We found that most of
                   the backbone amide groups of (1-71)bacterioopspin in
                   SDS micelles are involved in the conformational
                   exchange process over a rate range of 10(3) to 10(4)
                   s(-1). This conformational exchange is supposed to be
                   due to an interaction between two alpha-helixes of
                   (1-71)bacterioopsin, since the hydrolysis of the
                   peptide bond in the loop region results in the
                   disappearance of exchange line broadening. N-15
                   relaxation rates and H-1-N-15 NOE values were
                   interpreted using the model-free approach of Lipari and
                   Szabo [Lipari, G. and Szabo, A (1982). J Am. Chem.
                   Soc., 104, 4546-4559]. In addition to overall rotation
                   of the molecule, the backbone N-H vectors of the
                   peptides are involved in two types of internal motions:
                   fast, on a time scale <20 ps, and intermediate, on a
                   time scale close to 1 ns. The intermediate dynamics in
                   the alpha-helical stretches was mostly attributed to
                   bending motions. A decrease in the order parameter of
                   intermediate motions was also observed for residues
                   next to Pro(50), indicating an anisotropy of the
                   overall rotational diffusion of the molecule.
                   Distinctly mobile regions are identified by a large
                   decrease in the order parameter of intermediate motions
                   and correspond to the N- and C-termini, and to a loop
                   connecting the alpha-helixes of (1-71)bacterioopsin.
                   The internal dynamics of the alpha-helixes on the
                   millisecond and nanosecond time scales should be taken
                   into account in the development of a model of the
                   functioning bacteriorhodopsin.},

  abstract       = {Model-free analysis has been extensively used to
                   extract information on motions in proteins over a wide
                   range of timescales from NMR relaxation data. We
                   present a detailed analysis of the effects of
                   rotational anisotropy on the model-free analysis of a
                   ternary complex for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Our
                   findings show that the small degree of anisotropy
                   exhibited by DHFR (Dparallel/Dperpendicular = 1.18)
                   introduces erroneous motional models, mostly exchange
                   terms, to over 50\% of the NH spins analyzed when
                   isotropic tumbling is assumed. Moreover, there is a
                   systematic change in S2, as large as 0.08 for some
                   residues. The significant effects of anisotropic
                   rotational diffusion on model-free motional parameters
                   are in marked contrast to previous studies and are
                   accentuated by lowering of the effective correlation
                   time using isotropic tumbling methods. This is caused
                   by the preponderance of NH vectors aligned
                   perpendicular to the principal diffusion tensor axis
                   and is readily detected because of the high quality of
                   the relaxation data. A novel procedure, COPED
                   (COmparison of Predicted and Experimental Diffusion
                   tensors) is presented for distinguishing genuine
                   motions from the effects of anisotropy by comparing
                   experimental relaxation data and data predicted from
                   hydrodynamic analyses. The procedure shows excellent
                   agreement with the slow motions detected from the
                   axially symmetric model-free analysis and represents an
                   independent procedure for determining rotational
                   diffusion and slow motions that can confirm or refute
                   established procedures that rely on relaxation data.
                   Our findings show that neglect of even small degrees of
                   rotational diffusion anisotropy can introduce
                   significant errors in model-free analysis when the data
                   is of high quality. These errors can hinder our
                   understanding of the role of internal motions in
                   protein function.},

  abstract       = {The zinc finger DNA-binding domain Xfin-31 is a
                   25-residue peptide that binds a single zinc atom and
                   forms a compact globular structure in solution. To
                   characterize the intramolecular dynamics of Xfin-31,
                   the C-13 spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation rate
                   constants and the \{H-1\}-C-13 nuclear Overhauser
                   effect (NOE) enhancements have been measured for the
                   backbone and side chain methine carbons by
                   two-dimensional proton-detected heteronuclear NMR
                   spectroscopy at a C-13 Larmor frequency of 125 MHz and
                   natural C-13 abundance. The relaxation rate constants
                   and the NOE enhancements have been analyzed by using a
                   model-free formalism that depends on the overall
                   rotational correlation time of the molecule, tau-m, the
                   order parameter S, and effective internal correlation
                   time, tau-e, for each methine carbon. The optimized
                   global value of tau-m is 1.88 +/- 0.02 ns. The backbone
                   C-alpha carbons are grouped into four categories based
                   on the values of the order parameters: the N-terminal
                   residue Tyr1 with S2 = 0.73 +/- 0.04; the C-terminal
                   residues Lys24 and Asn25 with S2 < 0.5; residues
                   Phe10-Lysl3 with an average S2 = 0.77 +/- 0.03; and the
                   remainder of the backbone carbon nuclei with an average
                   S2 = 0.89 +/- 0.05. For the side chain C-beta of Val11
                   and Val22 and the C-gamma of Leu5, the values of S2 are
                   0.62 +/- 0.03, 0.66 +/- 0.04, and 0.47 +/- 0.03,
                   respectively. Estimates of tau-e could be obtained for
                   13 of the backbone and 3 of the side chain methine
                   carbons. Excluding the terminal residues, the average
                   value of tau-e for the backbone carbon nuclei was 34
                   +/- 16 ps. With the exception of the terminal residues,
                   the motions of the backbone carbon nuclei of Xfin-31
                   are highly restricted. Residues 10-13, which form a
                   turn between the beta-sheet and the helix present in
                   the three-dimensional structure of Xfin-31, have a
                   slightly higher mobility than the rest of the interior
                   backbone, and the two residues at the C-terminus have
                   considerable conformational flexibility. The side
                   chains of the hydrophobic Val and Leu residues are more
                   mobile than the backbone but are still significantly
                   restricted, which indicates that Xfin-31 is compact
                   despite its small size. Systematically large spin-spin
                   relaxation rates for residues in the zinc binding site
                   imply that conformational exchange may occur in this
                   region on a time scale longer than the overall
                   rotational correlation time.},

  abstract       = {Although an accurate description of global tumbling of
                   a protein is essential for correct analysis of internal
                   motions. proper distinction between the effects of
                   anisotropic rotational diffusion and conformational
                   exchange has remained a challenge. We present a novel
                   two-part filtering procedure designed specifically to
                   distinguish between the effects of anisotropy and
                   conformational exchange. The efficacy of this method is
                   assessed using synthetic data sets. The method is then
                   applied to two proteins of dramatically different size
                   and shape, OspA and SH3. The large size and extreme
                   anisotropy of OspA provide a challenging case, where
                   conformational exchange is a small perturbation of the
                   effects of anisotropy on transverse relaxation rates.
                   Conversely, in the chicken c-Src SH3 domain, with its
                   small size and nearly spherical shape, anisotropy is a
                   small perturbation of the effects of conformational
                   exchange on transverse relaxation rates. Accurate
                   extraction of the global tumbling parameters for each
                   protein allows optimal characterization of
                   conformational exchange processes, as well as ps-ns
                   time scale motions.},

  abstract       = {The effects of anisotropy of rotational diffusion and
                   extent of dimerization on the performance of the simple
                   and extended model-free formulas are investigated.
                   Numerically exact 15N NMR R1, R2, and NOE data are
                   simulated for cylindrically symmetric species and also
                   for mixtures of spherical monomers and dimers with the
                   same internal dynamics. The relevant internuclear
                   vectors are assumed to move in isotropic deflection
                   potentials fixed at different orientations in the
                   molecule and to exhibit a single relaxation time in
                   their internal correlation functions. The simple
                   model-free formula is fitted to these simulated data in
                   order to obtain the best-fit order parameter and
                   internal relaxation time for each nucleus. Fitting is
                   accomplished by the standard data-analysis protocol, in
                   which a single common global correlation time is
                   adjusted, and also by an alternative protocol, in which
                   the global correlation time is adjusted separately for
                   each nucleus. The extended model-free formula is
                   likewise fitted to these same data. With noise-free
                   data, the simple model-free formula and standard
                   protocol yield remarkably good best-fit internal motion
                   parameters up to moderate anisotropies (r = D
                   parallel/D perpendicular = 2.0), but some or many of
                   the NMR relaxation data are not fitted well even for
                   quite modest anisotropies (r = 1.3). The extended
                   model-free formula yields an improved fit to the NMR
                   data, but predicts substantial amplitudes of
                   nonexistent slow internal motions (tau approximately
                   greater than 0.2 ns) for many of the nuclei for all r >
                   or = 1.3. The simple model-free formula with the
                   alternate protocol yields even better internal motion
                   parameters than the standard protocol and also an
                   excellent fit to the NMR relaxation data. The best-fit
                   global correlation time for each nucleus corresponds
                   very closely to the theoretical correlation time
                   defined herein. Knowledge of these times would allow
                   one not only to estimate the anisotropy of diffusion
                   but also in favorable cases to infer the existence of
                   slow internal motions. Inclusion of typical statistical
                   errors in R1, R2, and NOE, or modest exchange
                   contributions to R2, seriously degrades the performance
                   of the simple model-free formula with either protocol,
                   especially in regard to the internal relaxation times,
                   which can exhibit very large deviations from their
                   input value even for spherical diffusors. When the
                   fraction of monomers existing as dimers lies in the
                   range 0.1 < or = fd < or = 0.8, none of the three
                   model-free approaches tested yields reliable internal
                   motion parameters.},

  abstract       = {Olfactory marker protein (OMP) is a highly expressed
                   and phylogenetically conserved cytoplasmic protein of
                   unknown function found almost exclusively in mature
                   olfactory sensory neurons. Electrophysiological studies
                   of olfactory epithelia in OMP knock-out mice show
                   strongly retarded recovery following odorant
                   stimulation leading to an impaired response to pulsed
                   odor stimulation. Although these studies show that OMP
                   is a modulator of the olfactory signal-transduction
                   cascade, its biochemical role is not established. In
                   order to facilitate further studies on the molecular
                   function of OMP, its crystal structure has been
                   determined at 2.3 A resolution using multiwavelength
                   anomalous diffraction experiments on selenium-labeled
                   protein. OMP is observed to form a modified
                   beta-clamshell structure with eight antiparallel
                   beta-strands. While OMP has no significant sequence
                   homology to proteins of known structure, it has a
                   similar fold to a domain found in a variety of existing
                   structures, including in a large family of viral capsid
                   proteins. The surface of OMP is mostly convex and
                   lacking obvious small molecule binding sites,
                   suggesting that it is more likely to be involved in
                   modulating protein-protein interaction than in
                   interacting with small molecule ligands. Three highly
                   conserved regions have been identified as leading
                   candidates for protein-protein interaction sites in
                   OMP. One of these sites represents a loop known to
                   mediate ligand interactions in the structurally
                   homologous EphB2 receptor ligand-binding domain. This
                   site is partially buried in the crystal structure but
                   fully exposed in the NMR solution structure of OMP due
                   to a change in the orientation of an alpha-helix that
                   projects outward from the structurally invariant
                   beta-clamshell core. Gating of this conformational
                   change by molecular interactions in the
                   signal-transduction cascade could be used to control
                   access to OMP's equivalent of the EphB2
                   ligand-interaction loop, thereby allowing OMP to
                   function as a molecular switch.},

                   IIA domain of the glucose permease of Bacillus subtilis
                   have been characterized using inverse-detected
                   two-dimensional H-1-N-15 NMR spectroscopy. Longitudinal
                   (T1) and transverse (T2) N-15 relaxation time constants
                   and steady-state \{H-1\}-N-15 NOEs were measured, at a
                   spectrometer proton frequency of 500 MHz, for 137
                   (91\%) of the 151 protonated backbone nitrogens. These
                   data were analyzed by using a model-free dynamics
                   formalism to determine the generalized order parameter
                   (S2), the effective correlation time for internal
                   motions (tau(e)), and N-15 exchange broadening
                   contributions (R(ex)) for each residue, as well as the
                   overall molecular rotational correlation time (tau(m)).
                   The T1 and T2 values for most residues were in the
                   ranges 0.45-0.55 and 0.11-0.15 s, respectively;
                   however, a small number of residues exhibited
                   significantly slower relaxation. Similarly,
                   \{H-1\}-N-15 NOE values for most residues were in the
                   range 0.72-0.80, but a few residues had much smaller
                   positive NOEs and some exhibited negative NOEs. The
                   molecular rotational correlation time was 6.24 +/- 0.01
                   ns; most residues had order parameters in the range
                   0.75-0.90 and tau(e) values of less than ca. 25 ps.
                   Residues found to be more mobile than the average were
                   concentrated in three areas: the N-terminal residues
                   (1-13), which were observed to be highly disordered;
                   the loop from P25 to D41, the apex of which is situated
                   adjacent to the active site and may have a role in
                   binding to other proteins; and the region from A146 to
                   S149. All mobile residues occurred in regions close to
                   termini, in loops, or in irregular secondary structure.},

Abstract = {{The absolute configuration of small crystallizable molecules can be
   determined with anomalous X-ray diffraction as shown by Bijvoet in 1951.
   For the majority of compounds that can neither be crystallized nor
   easily be converted into crystallizable derivatives, stereocontrolled
   organic synthesis is still required to establish their absolute
   configuration. In this contribution, a new fundamental methodology for
   resolving the absolute configuration will be presented that does not
   require crystallization. With residual dipolar coupling enhanced NMR
   spectroscopy, ensembles of a limited number of structures are created
   reflecting the correct conformations and relative configuration.

                   relaxation data are incompatible with isotropic
                   rotational diffusion but agree well with an axially
                   symmetric rotational diffusion tensor with a diffusion
                   anisotropy, D-parallel to/D-perpendicular to Of 1.17
                   There is no statistically significant further
                   improvement in the fit between the experimental data
                   and those predicted by a fully asymmetric diffusion
                   tensor, confirming that the rotational diffusion tensor
                   of ubiquitin is axially symmetric within experimental
                   uncertainty. The relative ratio of the principal
                   components of the inertia tensor calculated from the
                   X-ray structure is 1.00:0.90:0.64, and the axis with
                   the smallest inertia component makes an angle of 11
                   degrees with the unique axis of the experimentally
                   determined diffusion tenser. Hydrodynamic calculations
                   agree well with experimental results, provided half a
                   shell of bound water is included and flexibility of the
                   C-terminal residues is accounted for either by omitting
                   them from the calculations or by using conformations
                   for these residues obtained from a Langevin dynamics
                   simulation.},

  abstract       = {The backbone motions of calcium-free Xenopus
                   calmodulin have been characterized by measurements of
                   the 15N longitudinal relaxation times (T1) at 51 and 61
                   MHz, and by conducting transverse relaxation (T2),
                   spin-locked transverse relaxation (T1 rho), and
                   15N-[1H] heteronuclear NOE measurements at 61 MHz 15N
                   frequency. Although backbone amide hydrogen exchange
                   experiments indicate that the N-terminal domain is more
                   stable than calmodulin's C-terminal half, slowly
                   exchanging backbone amide protons are found in all
                   eight alpha-helices and in three of the four short
                   beta-strands. This confirms that the calcium-free form
                   consists of stable secondary structure and does not
                   adopt a 'molten globule' type of structure. However,
                   the C-terminal domain of calmodulin is subject to
                   conformational exchange on a time scale of about 350
                   microseconds, which affects many of the C-terminal
                   domain residues. This results in significant shortening
                   of the 15N T2 values relative to T1 rho, whereas the T1
                   rho and T2 values are of similar magnitude in the
                   N-terminal half of the protein. A model in which the
                   motion of the protein is assumed to be isotropic
                   suggests a rotational correlation time for the protein
                   of about 8 ns but quantitatively does not agree with
                   the magnetic field dependence of the T1 values and does
                   not explain the different T2 values found for different
                   alpha-helices in the N-terminal domain. These latter
                   parameters are compatible with a flexible dumb-bell
                   model in which each of calmodulin's two domains freely
                   diffuse in a cone with a semi-angle of about 30 degrees
                   and a time constant of about 3 ns, whereas the overall
                   rotation of the protein occurs on a much slower time
                   scale of about 12 ns. The difference in the transverse
                   relaxation rates observed between the amides in helices
                   C and D suggests that the change in interhelical angle
                   upon calcium binding is less than predicted by Herzberg

                   protease, complexed with the sub-nanomolar inhibitor
                   DMP323, have been measured at 600 and 360 MHz H-1
                   frequency. The relative magnitudes of the principal
                   components of the inertia tensor, calculated from the
                   X-ray coordinates of the protein-drug complex, are
                   1.0:0.85:0.44. The relation between the T-1/T-2 ratios
                   observed for the individual backbone amides and their
                   N-H orientation within the 3D structure of the protease
                   dimer yields a rotational diffusion tensor oriented
                   nearly collinear to the inertia tenser. The relative
                   magnitudes of its principal components (1.00:1.11:1.42)
                   are also in good agreement with hydrodynamic modeling
                   results. The orientation and magnitude of the diffusion
                   tensors derived from relaxation data obtained at 360
                   and 600 MHz are nearly identical. The anisotropic
                   nature of the rotational diffusion has little influence
                   on the order parameters derived from the N-15 T-1 and
                   T-2 relaxation times; however, if anisotropy is
                   ignored, this can result in erroneous identification of
                   either exchange broadening or internal motions on a
                   nanosecond time scale. The average ratio of the T-1
                   values measured at 360 and 600 MHz is 0.50+/-0.015,
                   which is slightly larger than the value of 0.466
                   expected for an isotropic rigid rotor with tau(c)=10.7
                   ns. The average ratio of the T-2 values measured at 360
                   and 600 MHz is 1.14+/-0.04, which is also slightly
                   larger than the expected ratio of 1.11, This magnetic
                   field dependence of the T-1 and T-2 relaxation times
                   suggests that the spectral density contribution from
                   fast internal motions is not negligible, and that the
                   chemical shift anisotropy of peptide backbone amides,
                   on average, is larger than the 160 ppm value commonly
                   used in N-15 relaxation studies of proteins.},

  abstract       = {The rotational diffusion and backbone dynamics of the
                   carbon monoxide-bound Rhodobacter capsulatus cytochrome
                   c' have been investigated using heteronuclear NMR
                   spectroscopy. This protein consists of a four-helix
                   bundle motif and a histidine-heme binding domain and
                   has been shown to form a symmetric dimer in the crystal
                   state. N-15 relaxation measurements reveal that an
                   asymmetric tensor is necessary to describe overall
                   rotational diffusion of the protein, showing a
                   significant improvement compared to analysis using
                   either isotropic and axially symmetric tensors. This
                   analysis indicates that the molecule undergoes
                   significant anisotropic reorientation with a diffusion
                   tensor having principal components \{1.37 +/- 0.05,
                   1.68 +/- 0.05, 2.13 +/- 0.07\} x 10(7) s-(1).
                   Hydrodynamic calculations performed on the crystal
                   structure predict values of \{1.400, 1.45, 2.12\} x
                   10(7) s(-1) when a solvent shell of 3.0 Angstrom is
                   included in the calculation. Comparison of the
                   principal axes with the symmetry axes of the dimeric
                   structure derived from X-ray crystallography provides
                   unambiguous evidence that the molecule is monomeric in
                   the solution state. Lipari-Szabo-type mobility
                   parameters extracted when using the anisotropic
                   description of overall tumbling are found to differ
                   considerably from those found assuming isotropic global
                   reorientation, where the internal dynamics of NH
                   vectors present in helical regions of the molecule
                   exhibit clear periodicity due to their orientation
                   relative to the diffusion tensor. In addition, the
                   relaxation properties of helix I are less well
                   reproduced than those of the other three helices,
                   implying a different orientation of this helix compared
                   to that found in the crystal state, possibly due to the
                   volume of the different ligands present in the two
                   forms of the protein. Using restrained molecular
                   dynamics and energy minimization with respect to the
                   relaxation rate ratios, we have quantified the
                   difference in the orientation of this helix and find
                   that a significant reorientation is necessary to
                   fulfill the measured relaxation rates.},

                   model was applied to (15)N NMR spin relaxation in
                   proteins and compared with the commonly used original
                   and extended model-free (MF) approaches. In MF, the
                   dynamic modes are assumed to be decoupled, local
                   ordering at the N-H sites is represented by generalized
                   order parameters, and internal motions are described by
                   effective correlation times. SRLS accounts for
                   dynamical coupling between the global diffusion of the
                   protein and the internal motion of the N-H bond vector.
                   The local ordering associated with the coupling
                   potential and the internal N-H diffusion are tensors
                   with orientations that may be tilted relative to the
                   global diffusion and magnetic frames. SRLS generates
                   spectral density functions that differ from the MF
                   formulas. The MF spectral densities can be regarded as
                   limiting cases of the SRLS spectral density. SRLS-based
                   model-fitting and model-selection schemes similar to
                   the currently used MF-based ones were devised, and a
                   correspondence between analogous SRLS and model-free
                   parameters was established. It was found that
                   experimental NMR data are sensitive to the presence of
                   mixed modes. Our results showed that MF can
                   significantly overestimate order parameters and
                   underestimate local motion correlation times in
                   proteins. The extent of these digressions in the
                   derived microdynamic parameters is estimated in the
                   various parameter ranges, and correlated with the time
                   scale separation between local and global motions. The
                   SRLS-based analysis was tested extensively on (15)N
                   relaxation data from several isotropically tumbling
                   proteins. The results of SRLS-based fitting are
                   illustrated with RNase H from E. coli, a protein
                   extensively studied previously with MF.},

                   rates of the internal rotations between the label and
                   the protein. The effective correlation time for the
                   label is simply a series of factors times the
                   correlation time for the rigid protein. Each internal
                   rotation which is much faster than the protein rotation

                   information from NMR relaxation times of nuclei in an
                   amino acid side chain containing multiple internal
                   rotation axes attached to a large macromolecule of at
                   least cylindrical symmetry is developed. Emphasis is
                   placed on the analysis of 13C-NMR of protonated carbons
                   where dipolar relaxation is predominant. Extension to
                   other relaxation processes is straightforward. The
                   spectral density from which the relaxation times can be
                   calculated is obtained for various models for the
                   motion of the side chain. The existing theory which
                   assumes that internal rotations are both independent
                   and free is generalized to incorporate excluded volume
                   effects in a heuristic way by restricting the amplitude
                   of the internal rotations. It is found that small
                   amplitude motions are ineffective in causing
                   relaxation. Thus jump models involving a relatively
                   small number of configurations are appropriate to
                   describe the motion of the side chain. The advantage of
                   jump models is twofold: (1) excluded volume effects can
                   be handled simply by including only sterically allowed
                   configurations, and (2) the unrealistic assumption of
                   diffusional models that rotations about different bonds
                   are independent can be removed by considering concerted
                   motions in which the positions of only a small number
                   of atoms are altered. An explicit expression for the

                   when the number of configurations is less than 200, is
                   obtained for a class of jump models in which the
                   dynamics is described by a master equation. A detailed
                   application of the general formalism is made to the
                   case of a lysine side chain whose carbon-carbon
                   backbone is constrained to lie on a tetrahedral
                   lattice. Finally, numerical calculations are presented
                   to illustrate some of the qualitative features of the
                   different models, and the strategy that can be used to
                   obtain motional information from experiment within the
                   framework of these models is discussed.},

                   data measured by proton-detected two-dimensional 1H-15N
                   NMR spectroscopy. 15N spin-lattice relaxation time
                   (T1), spin-spin relaxation time (T2), and heteronuclear
                   NOEs were determined for all visible backbone amide 15N
                   nuclei. Monte Carlo simulations of the amplitudes of
                   backbone motions led to the conclusion that a wobbling
                   in a cone model with consideration of the anisotropic
                   reorientation of the molecule was appropriate to
                   describe the underlying motions, allowing us to derive
                   the semiangle of the cone (alpha) and the effective
                   correlation time for internal motions (tau e) for each

                   perpendicular (D perpendicular) to the unique axis of
                   the molecule were found to be 1.48 +/- 0.06 x 10(7) and

                   semiangle of the cone (alpha) describing the amplitude
                   of NH vector motions on the picosecond time scale was
                   found to be 20.9 +/- 5.7 degrees. Large amplitude
                   motions on the picosecond time scale are found at both
                   the N and C termini but are restricted in both the

                   Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin at four magnetic fields
                   (500-900 MHz) and at two temperatures chosen well below
                   the melting point of the protein. Following a careful
                   model-free analysis, several protein regions with
                   different dynamic regimes are identified. Nanosecond
                   time-scale mobility characterizes various residues of
                   the hydrophobic surface patch believed to mark the
                   natural entry point for electrons, notably the
                   surface-exposed copper-ligand His117. These findings
                   are consistent with a gated electron transfer process
                   according to the "dynamic docking" model. Residues
                   47-49 along intramolecular pathways of electrons show
                   rigidity that is remarkably conserved when increasing
                   the temperature. Three different conformational
                   exchange processes were observed in the millisecond
                   range, one near the only disulfide bridge in the
                   molecule and two near the copper ion. The latter two
                   processes are consistent with previous data such as
                   crystal structures at various pH values and NMR
                   relaxation dispersion experiments; they may indicate an
                   additional gated electron transfer mechanism at slower

                   intended for nonspecialists who have knowledge of the
                   statistical concepts covered in a typical first
                   (occasionally second) statistics course. The intention
                   is to explain the ideas that generate frequentist
                   methodology for model selection, for example the Akaike
                   information criterion, bootstrap criteria, and
                   cross-validation criteria. Bayesian methods, including
                   the Bayesian information criterion, are also mentioned
                   in the context of the framework outlined in the paper.
                   The ideas are illustrated using an example in which
                   observations are available for the entire population of
                   interest. This enables us to examine and to measure
                   effects that are usually invisible, because in
                   practical applications only a sample from the
                   population is observed. The problem of selection bias,
                   a hazard of which one needs to be aware in the context
                   of model selection, is also discussed. Copyright 2000
