###############################################################################


Preparations
============

Prior to release, check that everything is ready.  These steps are now automated thanks to Travis CI (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_CI).  Simply check that the latest master branch builds are passing:

    - https://travis-ci.com/nmr-relax/relax/builds


Temporary branch
================

Firstly create and switch to a local, and temporary, git branch using commands such as:

$ git branch 4.1.0 master
$ git checkout 4.1.0

This will create a new branch explicitly from the master branch.  A number of changes will be committed to this branch prior to tagging and deletion of the temporary branch.



Version number
==============

Change the version number in file 'version.py' and commit the change with a commit message such as "Updated the version number to relax 4.1.0.".



PDF manual
==========

Build the PDF version of the relax user manual, add it to the repository, commit all changes, and clean up the temporary files by typing:

$ scons user_manual_pdf
$ git add -f docs/relax.pdf
$ git commit -m "Added the relax 4.1.0 manual to the repository."
$ scons clean

Copy the PDF manual to the mirror directory for the relax download site for uploading in one of the steps below.



CHANGES file
============

Review the git logs and add an entry into the CHANGES file (in the 'docs/' directory) for the current release.  Create three sections titled 'Features', 'Changes', and 'Bugfixes'.  The 'devel_scripts/log_converter.py' script can be used to generate the documentation, which will need major editing (the starting commit hash is from the CHANGES merge of the previous release):

$ git log --reverse 67b98d.. > log
$ ./devel_scripts/log_converter.py log > log_formatted

The result should be modified and every line checked.  Bugs should be in the 'Bugfixes' section only if it affects previous relax releases, otherwise it should be in the 'Changes' section.

The following should be removed:

    - Minor, insignificant, and unidentifiable changes such as "Import fix." (this is highly subjective).
    - All exclamation marks.
    - Message IDs for mailing list posts.
    - Merge commits.
    - The messages of all reverted commits.
    - All hash numbers such as '67b98d' or the word 'hash'.
    - The names and email addresses of committers or patch providers.
    - Remove or obscure all email addresses.
    - Spelling should be checked and proper punctuation used throughout, including two spaces after a period.

Commit the changes and cherry-pick the commit back into the master branch:

$ git checkout master
$ git cherry-pick [hash]



Tagging
=======

Next tag the release, remove the temporary branch, and push the tag to the remote repositories with:

$ git checkout 4.1.0
$ git tag -m "relax version 4.1.0." 4.1.0
$ git checkout master
$ git branch -D 4.1.0
$ git push --tags

If all the relax mirrors are configured as remotes with the 'pushremotes' alias, instead type:

$ git pushremotes --tags



Distribution files
==================

Repository preparation
----------------------

Update and clean relax repositories with:

$ git fetch --all --tags
$ git clean -ffxd    # Warning - permanent removal of all non-tracked files, including minfx and bmrblib git repository subdirectories.
$ git checkout 4.1.0


Package bundling
----------------

Bundle minfx and bmrblib by cloning the latest stable release tags, for example:

$ git clone --branch 1.0.12 --depth 1 git://git.code.sf.net/p/minfx/code minfx
$ git clone --branch 1.0.4 --depth 1 git://git.code.sf.net/p/bmrblib/code bmrblib


Source files
------------

Generate the source distribution files (and their GPG signatures) by typing:

$ scons source_dist key=xxxxx

where xxxxx is the name of your GPG key.  Files not within the git repository will be excluded.


Binary files
------------

Generate the binary distribution files for each platform (and their GPG signatures) by typing:

$ scons binary_dist key=xxxxx


Signing
-------

If the key is not supplied, or incorrectly supplied, the distribution file will be created but not signed.  To sign the file later, type:

$ gpg --detach-sign --default-key xxxxx relax-4.1.0.GNU-Linux.x86_64.tar.bz2


Other files
-----------

Build other distribution packages by checking out the tag and bundling minfx and bmrblib:

$ cd /relax/git/repository/directory/
$ git fetch --all --tags
$ git clean -ffxd    # Warning - permanent removal of all non-tracked files, including minfx and bmrblib git repository subdirectories.
$ git checkout 4.1.0
$ git clone --branch 1.0.12 --depth 1 git://git.code.sf.net/p/minfx/code minfx
$ git clone --branch 1.0.4 --depth 1 git://git.code.sf.net/p/bmrblib/code bmrblib
$ scons binary_dist [key=xxxxx]



Upload
======

Move the distribution files and their signatures to the mirror directory for the relax download site.  This directory should contain all the files and directories accessible from 'https://sourceforge.net/projects/nmr-relax/files/'.  First make sure the mirror directory contains all of the files so that the next command does not accidentally delete files:

$ rsync -av --progress --no-perms -e ssh edauvergne@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/nmr-relax/ .

Change "edauvergne" to your user name.  Then rsync the entire directory contents to download.gna.org/upload/relax/ using the command:

$ rsync --delete -avP --copy-links --progress --partial --no-perms -e ssh --numeric-ids . edauvergne@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/nmr-relax/

The upload script on the file mirror simplifies the upload process:

$ ./upload edauvergne



Website
=======

The website git repository is located at:

    - https://sourceforge.net/p/nmr-relax/website/ci/master/tree/


Commits and branches
--------------------

All website changes should be committed to the 'master' branch in the website repository:

$ git checkout master

These are then merged into the 'gh-pages' branch.  The website will be updated once the 'gh-pages' branch has been pushed to GitHub.


Downloads
---------

Modify the http://www.nmr-relax.com/download.html webpage to point to the newest version of relax.  Update the MD5 checksums and file sizes on the download page.  Commit the updates with a message such as "Updated the http://www.nmr-relax.com/download.html webpage for the relax 4.1.0 release.".


Manual
------

For the HTML manual, the latest 'relax_manual/rX' branch of the relax fork of latex2html must be used (https://sourceforge.net/p/nmr-relax/code-latex2html/ci/master/tree/).  The 'bmrblib/' and 'minfx/' directories from the checked out repositories must also be present.  Create the manual with the commands:

$ cd relax_git_repository_directory/
$ git checkout 4.1.0
$ scons user_manual_html

Replace the old manual with the new in the website repository:

$ cd website_git_repository_directory/
$ git checkout master
$ cd manual
$ ./clean
$ cp -urvp relax_git_repository_directory/docs/html/* .

To restore any missing redirects, finally run:

$ cd ..
$ python .setup_redirects.py

Commit the changes with a message such as "Updated the relax HTML manual at http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/index.html to version 4.1.0.".


API documentation
-----------------

Firstly make sure that epydoc has been updated with the docs/devel/epydoc_graphvis_fix.patch changes, to allow for newer Graphvis versions to correctly create graphs.  Then create the API documentation for the current version with the command:

$ cd relax_git_repository_directory/
$ git checkout 4.1.0
$ scons api_manual_html

Then:

    - Replace the old API documentation in the website repository and commit with a message such as "Updated the relax API documentation at http://www.nmr-relax.com/api/4.1/ to version 4.1.0.".
    - If a new minor version is being released, create a new directory such as api/4.1/, copy the files there.
    - Update the api/index.html file to add the new version, and commit with a message such as "Updated the relax version number to 4.1.0 on the http://www.nmr-relax.com/api/index.html webpage.".




SourceForge tickets
===================

Update the bug ticket tracker at https://sourceforge.net/p/nmr-relax/admin/tickets/fields.  In the 'Release' field add the version number to the end of the options.



FSF directory
=============

Update the version number in the FSF directory (http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Relax).



Announcement
============

Compose and edit the message on the relax wiki, then post the release message to the relax-announce mailing list.


Wiki
----

Create a new release page at the URL http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/Relax_x.y.z.  Use, for example, http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/Relax_4.0.1 as a guide.  The basic page structure is as follows:

    {{lowercase title}} - Start with this to allow the title to be in lowercase.  The URL on a wiki always starts with a capital, but the title can be changed to lowercase in this way.
    = Description = - Create this section by writing a detailed and full description of the release.  Add internal wiki links and external links, for example to the relax manual web pages for the user functions.
    = Download = - Create this section with links for downloading the release (simply copy the text from an older release).
    = CHANGES file = - Create this section by cutting and pasting the part of the CHANGES file for this release.  Convert the Features, Changes, and Bugfixes titles to the subsection format == Features ==, == Changes ==, and == Bugfixes ==.  Strip all leading whitespace from the full list of changes so that the wiki can format the text.
    = Links = - Links to the other release announcements.
    = Announcements = - A transcluded section using {{:relax release announcements}}.
    = See also = - Finally create this section which simply contains the text [[Category:Release_Notes]].

For the changes file text, make the following conversions:

    - Mediawiki syntax highlighting is a significant aid (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_editor_support#Vim, and type ":set syntax=mediawiki").
    - For all bugs, support requests, and tasks, make links to the tickets/trackers including the full description in the link:
        - To change "Bug #1 (https://sourceforge.net/p/nmr-relax/tickets/1/)" to "[https://sourceforge.net/p/nmr-relax/tickets/1/ Bug #1]", set the vim register "@t" in the .vimrc file with:  let @t='3dwr[/)i pxr]'
    - Make links to the relax manual for all user functions:
        - To replace "structure.add_sheet" with "[http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/structure_add_sheet.html structure.add_sheet]", set the vim register "@i" in the .vimrc file with:  let @i='v/[ ,\r\n]hxi[http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/pa.html pa]?[/\.[a-z_]*.htmlr_/user function'
        - To replace "frame_order.decompose user function" with "[http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/frame_order_decompose.html frame_order.decompose user function]", set the vim register "@u" in the .vimrc file with:  let @u='v/[ ,\r\n]hxi[http://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/pa.html p/user function2cwuser function]?[/\.[a-z_]*.htmlr_/user function'
    - Make internal links for all relax versions (vi search for "[1-4]\.[0-9]*\.[0-9]*").
    - Convert all symbols to use wiki formatting.
    - Convert all model parameters to use the {{:xyz}} parameter template infrastructure.
    - Convert all model names to internal wiki links (vi search "\<m[0-9]\>\|\<tm[0-9]\>\|No Rex\|R2eff\|LM63\|LM63 3-site\|CR72\|CR72 full\|IT99\|TSMFK01\|B14\|B14 full\|NS CPMG\|MMQ CR72\|NS MMQ\|M61\|DPL94\|TP02\|TAP03\|MP05\|NS R1rho\|BK13").
    - Add as many links as possible to the API documentation (to help users dive into the relax code and to help with search engine indexing).  Open up the API documentation index (e.g. http://www.nmr-relax.com/api/4.1/identifier-index.html) and manually create the links.  This is a tedious task!
    - Add <code> tags for better formatting of certain elements (file and directory names, code elements, console output, GUI element, etc).
    - Convert any direct links if possible.
    - To avoid dead links, perform a final proof that all the links in the wiki article are correct by following the links.
    - Write a description for the release.

Note for the Vim registers, that:

    -  is the Enter key.
    -  is the Esc key.

Also:

    - Update all of the release note links for the new version (http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/Category:Release_Notes).  This required the mailing list message to be sent first.
    - Update the version number at http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/Template:Current_version_relax.
    - Add the new version number to the previous relax release wiki page infobox.


Mailing list
------------

On the relax-announce mailing list (nmr-relax-announce att lists.sourceforge.net), write the release announcement:

    - Subject:  "relax version 4.1.0."
    - Copy the 'Description' and 'Download' text from the wiki.  Do not include the section titles and remove any wiki markup, converting any important links to direct text.
    - Add a paragraph before the 'Download' paragraph with the text 'For the official, easy to navigate release notes, please see http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/Relax_4.1.0 .'.  This is to direct both users and search engines to the wiki page (the users via the release email and the search engines via the multiple archives).
    - At the end, add a section titled 'The full list of changes is:' and cut and paste the part of the CHANGES file for this release, removing one level of indentation (4 spaces).  Do not use the wiki text for this.
    - Include links to the trackers in the full list of changes, if not already present.


Softpedia
---------

Most of the time, Softpedia will update their webpages for new releases.  If this does not occur after a week, inform Softpedia of the new release.  Use text such at "I would like to inform you of a new relax version announced at http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/Relax_4.1.0.".  The 

    - Softpedia page for relax on GNU/Linux:  http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Science/relax-22351.shtml
    - Softpedia page for relax on MS Windows:  http://www.softpedia.com/get/Science-CAD/relax-project.shtml
    - Softpedia page for relax on Mac OS X:  http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Math-Scientific/Edward-relax.shtml


Cross-linking
-------------

For better indexing by search engines, cross-link all the release announcements on the Wiki.  It may take a few days for all the links to be created.  For example for the relax 4.1.0 wiki article, use:

"""
For reference, the announcement for this release can also be found at following links:

* [http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/Relax_4.1.0 Official release notes on the relax wiki].
* [https://sourceforge.net/p/nmr-relax/mailman/message/36593472/ Mailing list message].
* [https://www.mail-archive.com/nmr-relax-announce@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00001.html The Mail Archive].

{{:Softpedia}}
"""

Not all of these links may work, as the email archives are not 100% perfect.


README file
-----------

For the SourceForge download area, a reStructuredText formatted README.rst file should be created.  This is automatically generated from the wiki page using html2rst (https://sourceforge.net/projects/html2rst/).  Install the program and run:

$ html2rst --embedded-hyperlink http://wiki.nmr-relax.com/Relax_4.1.0 $RELAX_DOWNLOAD_PATH/4.1.0/README.rst

Delete the wiki navigation text under the main title, make any fixes for wiki Lua errors (copy and modify the infobox table from an earlier README.rst file), delete all sections at the end from the "Navigation menu" to the image substitution definitions (e.g. ".. |relax logo| image:: "), delete the "|GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPL-3.0)|" and "|Powered by MediaWiki|" image references, and readd the image substitution definitions from an earlier README.rst file if Lua errors occurred.  The "|relax logo|" and "|The PDF version of the relax 4.1.0 user manual|" references may need to be shifted to be under the infobox table at the start, if SourceForge truncate the README.rst file.

Also add the relax release to the base README.rst file in the file download area.
