        * Addition of the frame_order.ref_domain() user function to specify the alignment of different domains.
        * Converted the reduced J(w) mapping sample script to the relax 1.3 design to make it functional.
        * Created the 'rigid' frame order model.
        * Made the profile module optional, removing the dependency on the Python development packages.
        * Created the maths_fns.rotation_matrix.axis_angle_to_quaternion() function.
        * Created the maths_fns.rotation_matrix.quaternion_to_axis_angle() function.
        * Created the maths_fns.rotation_matrix.R_to_quaternion() function.
        * relax save files are now by default XML formatted rather than the pickle format (for better compatibility with future relax versions and between different systems).

        * Redesign of the spin.create() and residue.create() user functions - respectively residue and molecule names and numbers are used instead of the res_id and mol_id arguments, allowing residues and molecules to be created as needed.
        * Modified the full_analysis.py script to perform 500 Monte Carlo simulations and turned on automatic looping.
        * Support for non-identical sequences in different PDB files within the same data pipe (only as different molecules, not different models).

        * A section called the 'The core design of relax' has been added to the the development chapter of the manual.
        * The 'Values, gradients, and Hessians' chapter of the manual is now complete.  These are all the equations used during optimisation.
        * The Hessian kite diagram and the gradient construction diagram have been added to the 'Values, gradients, and Hessians' chapter of the manual.

    Changes:
        * The distribution archives now unpack to the directory 'relax-x.x.x' rather than just 'relax', where x.x.x is the version number.
        * All chapters of the manual have been edited and proofed.
        * The Sparky and XEasy peak intensity reading functions have been split to allow the easy addition of new peak intensity file types.
        * Test of AIC model selection between diffusion tensors added to the test suite.  (To catch bug #5746)
        * Changing of the local tm parameter name of 'tm' to 'local_tm' to distinguish it from the global tumbling time 'tm'. (Preparation for fixing bug #6384)

    Bugfixes:
        * Fix of bug where self.relax.data.select_sim was treated as a list. (bug #5977)
        * The value.copy() function now handles the value of None. (bug #6288)
        * The global flag is now set by the relax_data.delete() function. (bug #6383)
        * The model-free model_statistics() function now tests for the presence of relaxation data. (bug #5806)
        * Sorting of global from local parameters in 'generic_fns/value.py' simplified and fixed by changing the parameter name 'tm' to 'local_tm'. (bug #6384)
        * Model-free parameters now set in the OpenDX mapping test of the test-suite. (bug #6388)
        * Failure of model elimination because of a 'local_tm' and 'tm' mix up. (bug #6389)
        * Modification of the model-free calculate() function and elimination of the 'combined' flag from the self.model_statistics() function. (bug #5746)



Version 1.2.4
(2 May 2006, from /1.2)
http://svn.gna.org/svn/relax/tags/1.2.4

    Features:
        * Added elimination of Monte Carlo simulations to the sample scripts.
        * Creation of the relax test suite 'relax --test-suite'.
        * Creation of the committers file.
        * The hyperref LaTeX package is now used in the relax manual.
        * Addition of a chapter called 'Open source infrastructure'.
        * Rewrite of the 'Development of relax' chapter.
        * Addition of the user function 'run.hybridise()'. (task #3122)
        * The user function 'relax_data.read()' no longer deselects residues when no data is encountered. (bug #5501)
        * Residues are deselected by the user functions 'grid_search()', 'calc()', and 'minimise()' if k > n or if there is less than 3 data sets. (bug #5501)
        * Mapping parameter values onto the structure through Molmol macros. (task #3146)
        * Added support for arbitrary colour gradients in the Molmol macros. (task #3146)
        * Addition of a file for colour operations.  All X11 colours and all Molmol colours can be selected by name. (task #3146)

    Changes:
        * The 'full_analysis.py' sample script now only searches over 6^6 rather than 11^6 grid points for the ellipsoid diffusion tensor to speed up the analysis.
        * Updated the manual to replace the references to 'make' with 'sconstruct'.
        * Extension of the installation chapter.
        * Changed the square and round brackets to curly brackets and replaced ':' with '=' in the user function docstrings.
        * All the model-free Molmol functions have been moved into their own class Molmol.
        * The null device can now be opened instead of a file for writing by passing 'devnull' as the name.
        * Updated the release checklist so that the directory 'relax-x.x.x' is included in the distributions rather than just 'relax'.
        * Removed the bugs file 'docs/BUGS'.

    Bugfixes:
        * Small bugs in the sconstruct script have been removed.
        * The value reading function can now handle rows which contain no data.
        * The ellipsoid diffusion tensor was being incorrectly initialised in the 'full_analysis.py' script.
        * Another Numeric version issue.  The model m0 with no parameters which used to be handled okay by the grid search and minimisation code was failing due to changes in Numeric.
        * In certain situations, the angle folding function which is called after model-free minimisation used the wrong run name.
        * Fixed the -fPIC option segfault problem on some Linux systems. (bug #5473)
        * Changed the tm grid search which was between 6-12 ns to be between 1-12ns.
        * Fixed some grammar in the intro chapter of the manual.
        * Fixed a bug in the model-free sample script in the spheroid diffusion tensor function.
        * Removed the spaces in front of the \index{} commands from the manual LaTeX source files.
        * The diffusion parameters 'Diso', 'Dper', 'Dpar', 'Dratio', 'Dx', 'Dy', and 'Dz' are generated on the fly. (bug #5559)
        * Fixed the spacing after 'Gna!' in the manual.
        * The 'grace.write()' user function now plots the associated errors. (bug #5659)
        * Fix to the parameter errors not being scaled in the value.read() user function. (bug #5670)
        * Parameter errors were not always included in the results file. (bug #5660)
        * Removed the memory leak in the relaxation curve-fitting C modules. (bug #5602)
        * The user function 'value.set()' no longer raises RelaxError in spectral density mapping runs. (bug #5698)
        * Fix to the broken Molmol pipe. (bug #5752)
        * Fix of the failure of molmol.view() when the PDB is missing. (bug #5753)
        * Fix to the failure of relax_data.read() when relaxation data is missing. (bug #5805)
