Frame order test models
=======================


The PDB files
-------------

The frame order test models herein are constructed from the original reference structures:

    N-domain:  1J7O_1st_NH.pdb
    C-domain:  1J7P_1st_NH.pdb

The C-domain structure is used to create distributions of structures matching the various frame order models.  These, together with a set of alignment tensors, are used to create lists of RDCs and PCSs representing the various motional models.  Then reduced tensors are calculated for the out-of-frame rotated C-domain structure:

    C-domain rotated:  1J7P_1st_NH_rot.pdb

This rotation is to simulate the experimental experience whereby the starting structures are not located at the rigid body average position (which in this case is the original C-domain position).


The numbers
-----------

The pivot point is defined as being between C_alpha of residue Met 76 of model 1 of 1J7O:
    pos1 = array([40.325, 1.549, 13.359])
and the backbone N of residue Glu 82 of model 1 of 1J7P:
    pos2 = array([34.183, -0.549, 20.134]).
The pivot is therefore located at:
    pivot = array([ 37.254, 0.5, 16.7465])

The mass and CoM positions for the 3 structures are:

1J7O_1st_NH.pdb:
    Total mass:      M = 1219.2527599999992
    Centre of mass:  R = array([ 41.73908729,   6.02977539,  -0.76356475])

1J7P_1st_NH.pdb:
    Total mass:      M = 1085.12894
    Centre of mass:  R = array([ 26.83678091, -12.37906417,  28.34154128])

1J7P_1st_NH_rot.pdb:
    Total mass:      M = 1085.12894
    Centre of mass:  R = array([ 48.10599831,  -9.25645351,  30.74219371])
