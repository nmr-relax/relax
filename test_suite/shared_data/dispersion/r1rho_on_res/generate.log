"""Simulate relaxation curves for an on resonance R1rho-type experiment using the M61 model.

This is the Meiboom 1961 model for 2-site fast exchange.  The equation is:

                       phi_ex * kex
    R1rho = R1rho' + ----------------- ,
                     kex^2 + omega_e^2

where R1rho' is the R1rho value in the absence of exchange,

    phi_ex = pA * pB * delta_omega^2 ,

kex is the chemical exchange rate constant, pA and pB are the populations of states A and B, delta_omega is the chemical shift difference between the two states (in rad/s), and omega_e is the effective field in the rotating frame.

To run the script, simply type:

$ ../../../../relax generate.py --tee generate.log
